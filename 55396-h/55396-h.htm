<p class='pindent'>The family of the Widow Berien had risen from
their evening devotions, and were preparing to hasten
to bed that they might rest from the toils of the
day past, and to prepare for the fatigues of that
which was to come. One by one they had taken
leave of the mistress of the house, and had withdrawn,
and Louise advanced to give her mother the evening kiss
and receive the evening benediction—when the mother
pointed to a chair and requested her daughter to sit
down. The movements of the girl evinced an understanding
of the object of her mother, and her countenance
showed that she had drawn herself up to sustain
the rebuke which had been prepared for her, for when
both were seated Louise turned her face to her mother
to discover, if possible, by the appearance of severity
there, how the storm was to commence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen Adolph again, to-day,” said Madam
Berien, in a mild tone, and with a glance which conveyed
nothing like anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met him returning from the field.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is scarcely necessary for me to repeat what he
said or what I replied—it was probably not much different
from what others in similar circumstances say.
Not greatly different from what passed between you
and my father at our ages, and in our situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that, Louise, shows me that you still persist
in the resolution to marry Adolph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have changed neither my inclinations nor my
wishes so far as I may resolve on such matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my opinions are to go for nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you say that, dear mother? Can you say
that your opinion, your command, and your wishes go
for nothing, when for two years I have postponed our
union solely in deference to your <span class='it'>wishes</span>, and here
renew my promise, that while I will marry no one but
Adolph, in my present state of feeling, I will assuredly
not marry him until you shall have given your consent,
or at least, withdrawn your opposition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My consent will not easily be obtained under
existing circumstances. I do not object to the condition,
appearance, or general conduct⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On what then, dear mother, have you founded
your hostility to Adolph?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On nothing. I have no hostility to Adolph—I wish
him well—I love him as the son of my cousin, on his
father’s side, and his mother was the friend and companion
of my childhood, and both of them were my
long continued neighbors—but⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what, mother? Tell me, is there any secret
reason for your dislike to the connection with the
family? Has he or have his parents committed crimes
which would bring disgrace upon us if known? Tell
me; I would not do aught that might be construed into
discredit; nor would I have my happiness destroyed
by vague insinuations—speak to me, mother, plainly.
I can bear the truth. I have too much of your own
character to shrink from what I ought to know or
ought to do, and I have also too much of your firmness
to relinquish a settled object on account of imaginary
or only great difficulties. I can bear disappointment if
it is in the way of duty, or I can meet and conquer obstacles.
Let me know on what ground I stand. If
Adolph has committed aught against the laws, or if
there is aught against his condition which should
operate with the most delicate and fastidious, I can
and will relinquish all association with him. I know
how necessary his presence is to my happiness, but I
know also how cherished is the good name of the
family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louise, you know how amid all the tumults of the
revolutions with which the country has been visited;
revolutions that shook the throne and altar—revolutions
that in attempting to purify the political condition
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
of the nation destroyed its religion; you know, how
amid all these tumults and disorganizations, when religion
had been driven by the sword from her temples,
and by ridicule from our dwellings, I have sought to
cherish her in our domestic circle. Morning and evening
have I gathered you around our family altar, and
sought to keep alive in you the faith which has been
the salvation of man, and which must be the guardian
of woman’s position and woman’s purity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, dear mother,” said Louise, as she recalled
all the cares and labor which had been used to keep
her feet in the ways of truth. “I know, dear mother,
how great has been your devotion; how constant your
vigilance in our behalf, and how your service has been
that of the priest at well as the mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thus, my dear child, while the wickedness and
folly of our people have done more against religion
than heresy itself would attempt, while the services of
the altar have been performed to such a meagre audience,
that the voice of the priest has been echoed
along the vacant aisles of the church, and no impressions
of religion on the Sabbath have sanctified a
thought on the other days of the week; nay, when as
in some of the neighboring cities and villages, the
priest himself has poured ridicule on his office, and
made the mysteries of religion a theme for mirth and
laughter, till children have done mockery to their God
and his service, by mimicking in their plays the solemnities
of the sanctuary, and have been encouraged
and rewarded by the laughter and applause of men and
women; have I not sought to save you from the contamination,
and to keep alive in your heart the love of
God and a conformity to the will of his Church?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have, you have, dear mother, and I sometimes
have thought when I have kneeled with you in
morning and evening devotion, that you had gathered
up the fragments of the consecrated yet broken altar,
to erect a place of sacrifice in your own heart, and I
have loved religion more that you have pleaded its
cause, strengthened its sentiment in my bosom, and
stood forward for all the duties and services which
may be performed by one of our sex. And I know,
dear mother, that the will for the sacraments, the
pure intentions which you excite are better, more profitable
to us than the sacraments themselves without
such intentions. But why, dear mother, do you now
with such solemnity recall these things; why, when
alluding to my relations with Adolph, do you refer to
your religious zeal and effective exertions? Poor as
have been the fruits from your cultivation of my religious
sentiments, have I ever denied or derided what
you taught? has my conduct ever done injustice to the
lessons of love and purity you have imparted? or have
I ever said aught that intimated a doubt of, or disrelish
for, the doctrine and service of our holy church? I
ask not in anger; I ask not, indeed, in unsanctified
confidence, but I ask in sincerity—if I have offended
against God and the church, let me know my errors;
nay, while sensible of my want of zeal and efforts toward
perfection, I avow myself ready and willing to
improve by any advice or corrective which you may
impart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not, my dear child, had reason to doubt of
the exactness and purity of your faith—no observation
which I have been able to make, and I have carefully
watched—oh! how vigilant must a widowed mother
be over the purity of faith and conduct of her orphan
daughter—I have, I repeat to you, found nothing in
your faith to reprove, nothing in your religion and
stated exercises unworthy of a Christian. But⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, mother—but—what can you mean? You talk
to me earnestly of my association with, and my affection
for Adolph—you allude to my faith and my conduct,
and say that you find nothing in my faith to censure,
and nothing in my <span class='it'>religious</span> exercises unworthy
a Christian, but you omit to approve of my <span class='it'>conduct</span>.
You avoid reference to that, unless you were approaching
it with the terrible—‘But.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was approaching it—and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does my mother mean that there is aught in my
conduct, my conduct with Adolph, because it is evident
that the remarks all tend thitherward—does my mother
suspect impropriety of conduct in me—mother,
mother, for Heaven’s sake, spare me that imputation.
For me and my thoughts, my inmost thoughts, your
chamber has been as much the seat of the confessional
as the place of the altar, and not a feeling of my heart,
not an impulse of passion, not a motive or a wish has
been withheld from you that would have been uttered
in explanation or confession to the priest. I know
there is wrong, dear mother, in the world. I am
human, with human passions and human weaknesses,
but not a thought of impurity has ever been uttered to
me by Adolph, or been suggested by our relations with
each other. Blessed queen of purity! in this thing I
am innocent, in word and thought. Dear mother, let
me not suffer—let not Adolph suffer in your estimation
upon such a suspicion, he is above such weakness and
wickedness, and I should need no further monition
from Heaven to avoid his society, than the discovery
that his words, nay, that our meeting suggested thoughts
unsanctioned by my religion, unworthy of your approval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louise paused in her vehement appeal. She had
gone to the very verge of propriety in her asseverations,
and she saw nothing in her mother’s countenance
which indicated any change of sentiment. The girl
felt for a moment indignant. The language of her mother
implied a charge of the most painful character, and
though it might not reach to the extent which, at first,
she seemed to suppose, yet she felt that maidenly propriety
is scarcely less outraged by an imputation of
habitual association with the dangerous and the impure,
than by a charge of crime committed—and she
started at the bare hint of the wrong, and was stung to
the soul when her vehement disclaimer seemed to
work no change in the mind of her accusing mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warmth of Louise’s feelings betrayed no disrespect
to her mother, and perhaps the good woman felt
pleased at the sensitiveness of her daughter on such a
subject. Still there was no removal of the objection
which was felt against Adolph, and she replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your justification of your conduct, and your sensitiveness
on the subject to which you supposed I referred,
show how important you and all deem the fame
of a young woman; how essential to her is not only a
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
pure mind, but an unsuspected character; and that to
which I have referred is so intimately connected with
what you suspect, that I shall take your virtuous indignation
at what you imagined my allusion, as almost as
applicable to my meaning as to your suspicions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it you mean, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, that with all the kindness of Adolph’s
manners—with all the respect he has shown for me,
and his affection to you, he is tainted with the infidelity
of the times, and not merely neglects the offices of the
church, but ridicules the Christian religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never, mother, never; depend on it, some one has
slandered Adolph to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does Adolph frequent, I will not say the <span class='it'>sacraments</span>
of his church, but the church itself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see him frequently there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see him there, my daughter, when he expects
you are ready to return—but never does he assist in
the services of the church?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not able to assert how often he attends the
church, mother; but I think as frequently as most of
the young men of this department, at least, of our village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be, my child, but it is of the general
prevalence of irreligion in which it seems that Adolph
shares, that I complain—and you know, my daughter,
that following your father’s advice, on his death-bed, I
have said in the language of the King of Israel, ‘as for
me and my house, we will serve the Lord.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And God forbid, my dear mother, that I should
hinder the fulfillment of your pious resolution, or be an
exception in your religious family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet you will be, if you yoke yourself unequally
with one who, if not a heretic, is only not <span class='it'>that</span> from
his indifference to any religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not, of course, assume that yoke without
your approval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is in a spirit of obedience; but, my daughter,
it would be better if instead of limiting yourself not to
marry any one without my approval, you would consent
to advise with me as to some proper person
among your acquaintance whom you <span class='it'>would</span> marry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear mother, the only equality in such a yoke
of convenience would be the perfect indifference with
which each would regard the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louise was not a little shocked at the remarks made
by her mother. She loved Adolph, and she knew well
enough that he did not frequent the church, though she
had never heard him ridicule religion, his respect for
her and her religious habits would have prevented that
outrage. But she could not shut her eyes to the fact
that Adolph lived <span class='it'>out</span> of the influences of her church,
and she knew well that her mother would never consent
to her union with such a man. She mingled the
subject in her prayers before she sought her bed, and
gave the whole night to the anxiety which it caused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day Louise opened her heart to Adolph, by expressing
her fears that he had neglected the duties of
his religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph sought to evade the matter by some playful
remarks, but he discovered that Louise was more than
usually in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother is in this,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is—and she adds, that I shall never marry a
man who neglects the requirements of religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, is she going to make a priest of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not,” said Louise; “for in that case we
should be further from our marriage than we now
are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does she require?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She requires that you forbear, in the first place,
any remarks against religion; and secondly, that you
frequent the church, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do that to please her and you, at any rate,”
said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will do it from a higher motive, I hope,” said
she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of the conference between Louise and
Adolph was the promise on his part to be constant at
church on all holydays, and to forbear any remarks
which could be construed into a disrespect for religion
and its ministers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louise retired gratified at what she had gained, but
not without some sense of the unworthiness of the motives
of her lover, and with many doubts whether she
ought to depend on such a shallow change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph loved Louise—he promised readily—but he
smiled in his heart at her seeming confidence. The
truth was Adolph <span class='it'>had</span> ridiculed religion; not so much
from any doubts of its truth, or any conclusions to
which he had been led by argument, as by the necessity
of improper association, the power of that state of
mind that builds up skepticism as a sort of retreat from
the stings of conscience. The moral principal of
Adolph had suffered much from his associations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a source of much gratification to Louise that
Adolph kept his word—and Madam Berien could not
deny that he was punctual in his attendance at the
church, if not exceedingly edifying in his deportment.
This brought Adolph more within the influence of
Madam Berien’s family, and that influence could not
fail of being beneficial; he certainly was saved from
much wrong if he was not influenced to do a great deal
of what was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such however was the force of example, that
Adolph’s habit of going to church seemed to be growing
into a principle. And influenced by the delicate
persuasion of Louise he even commenced a preparation
for the sacraments. The progress in the work of
piety was most gratifying to his betrothed, and even
received some applause from her mother. The good
woman was at length persuaded to give her consent to
the union of her daughter with him, and the marriage
was to take place immediately after Easter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We need not speak of the happiness, and the bustle
which such a consent produced in the family. With
Louise it was a calm joy. It was to be the fulfillment
of her heart’s dearest wish. She had as she believed
prepared herself for it by humble prayer and careful
watching, and she had aided in fitting her lover to be
her husband, by a gentle forbearance with his peculiarities,
and delicate suggestions as it regarded his errors.
He was a better man, more worthy of being the
son-in-law of her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph felt that he had enough in Louise to make him
forget the follies of his previous life, and though he had
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
not the most entire confidence in himself, yet he knew
that with her vigilance and her delicacy he should be
in little danger of being less worthy of her than he then
was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is due to truth to say, that while Louise put confidence
in the <span class='it'>resolution</span> of her lover, she did not feel
that he was out of danger when out of her influence—danger
not yet of open vice and profligacy, but of a
neglect of religious duties and a resumption of those
habits which had so nearly made shipwreck of him
before. But he was not to be out of her influence—he
was not to be removed from beneath her watchful eye.
The marriage which was to take place in a few weeks
would make him an inmate of her mother’s house,
where, indeed, already the sweetness of his disposition
and his manly bearing had made him a favorite. So
that Madam Berien, while she thanked God for the
earnestness with which she had dealt with her daughter
and his regard, confessed that his conduct now was
irreproachable, and that even the religious sentiment
seemed to be fully re-established in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near the close of a day early in April, that
the family of Madam Berien was gathered around a
table which seemed supplied with almost every thing
but eatables. It was the finishing up of the wedding-dresses,
and they had been about so long that there
was no more pretence at concealing their uses, or hesitancy
in referring to the ceremony and the time when
they were to be used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam Berien had just finished, for the twentieth
time, a detail of the arrangements, when the curé
arrived. He was always a welcome visiter at the
house. His labors were lightened by the beautiful example
of the family, and his wants in some measure
supplied by their charitable piety. He was at home,
for he felt that he might indulge there in any little sallies
of wit and pleasantry, without the danger of having
his language quoted to sustain irreverence; and he
could speak of religion and its offices, with a certainty
that those with whom he conversed sympathized
with all his feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of the appropriate merriment, in which
real happiness rather than boisterous mirth seemed to
predominate, a knocking at the door announced the
approach of a stranger. He was ushered into the
humble apartment, and presented the appearance of
a veteran soldier of some consideration in the service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been directed,” said the military visiter,
“by persons in the village, to call at this house for
citizen Adolph Lefevre. As my business is of an important
kind, madam will, I hope, excuse my intrusion
upon her domestic privacy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph rose, and announced himself as the person
inquired for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case,” said the visiter, “I have reason to
be gratified with my call; the nation cannot fail to
derive service from so finely proportioned a soldier.
I bear, sir, to you a notice that you have been honored
with a call to be mustered immediately into the service—as
a conscript.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A conscript! I am, sir, a conscript for 18—, but
not of the present, nor even of the next year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am aware, citizen conscript,” said the military
gentleman, growing more and more civil as he meant to
be more and more imperative, “I am aware of the year
of your conscription, but the necessities of the grand
army have compelled the emperor to anticipate a year
or two; and you, who would otherwise have been no
candidate for the cross of the legion of honor for two
years at least, are now presented with the opportunity,
which, of course, every Frenchman desires, of serving
your country, without any such delay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer presented Adolph with a paper which
contained the order for his departure, fixed the day,
and named the place of rendezvous; and then, with
military grace, took leave of the family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not possible to describe the misery which this
order had brought into the family. Six months before,
Adolph would have thought less of the dangers of the
camp, and Madam Berien would have felt relieved by
his departure; now, the thought of separation was
terrible. The certainty seemed for a time to have
paralyzed the family. The marriage was, of course,
to be postponed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could,” said Louise, to the curé, “I could have
sustained the blow better, had I perfect confidence in
the strength of Adolph’s power of resistance. It is not
my disappointment that makes me weep; if I know
my heart, dear father, it is the apprehension for
Adolph’s moral safety. He must be exposed to all
the debasing influences of a great army, and to all the
dangers of association with men who make a mockery
of all that is holy in religion, and all that is decent in
morals; and he must stand the taunts and jibes of some
of those from whom he has recently been attracted.
He will fall, assuredly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us pray for his endurance of the trial,” said
the curé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us find some one,” said Louise, “that will
assist to sustain his resolution of good, that will watch
over him, and admonish him of his dangers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who shall do that,” said Father Rudolph, “but
who e’er it may be, he turneth a sinner from his
ways, and hideth a multitude of sins. It is a blessed
office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” said Madam Berien, “are there now no
chaplains in the army?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, my child!” said the venerable curé, “war
is not carried on now with that formality and parade
which once distinguished it. The rapid movements
of the troops give but little chance for religious impressions,
and the morals of a camp seem to preclude
the hope of any demand for clerical aid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How few of our army escape death or incurable
wounds!” said madam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas!” said Louise, “it is the camp more than the
field that I dread; death or wounds are less injurious
than the decayed morals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was trouble in the family of Madam Berien,
trouble in the heart of Adolph. He was too young,
too much a Frenchman of the time, to express an open
regret at joining the army, and so he mourned his separation
from Louise, and the disappointment of his marriage
hopes, secretly. He dreaded the dangers of the
association. He had really improved; he had begun
to love virtue as he loved Louise; and he feared the
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
consequence of the want of her influence in the cause
of his improvement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night before the departure of the few conscripts
which were to leave the village, was spent by
Adolph at Madam Berien’s; the curé was present
most of the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning the busy movement in the place denoted
that all were ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louise had only one word of farewell, one kiss to
give, and her part was accomplished—and her heart
sunk within her as she placed upon Adolph’s neck a
little medal, which she carefully hid beneath his dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ferry-boat that crosses the river some distance
above the village, received the conscripts, and many
of their friends, who would accompany them to the
rendezvous beyond the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The neat uniform of the regiment sat well upon
Adolph’s manly form; and as he stood on the boat and
took his parting glass with one of the principal dignitaries
of the village, he looked as if he deserved
golden instead of worsted epaulets. One friend only
accompanied the youth—it was his faithful dog, Ponto,
who shared in</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>The Conscript’s Departure</span>.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The regiment was mustered—it joined others—and
in a few days was on its march to be united with an
attachment of the grand army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The army of the French, in those days to which we
refer, was not of a kind to be overlooked, whereever
it encamped, or whithersoever it marched; but
just in proportion to the obtrusiveness of the whole was
the indistinctness of its parts; and though each man
in the ranks was made to feel something of personal
identity, yet few out of the ranks looked upon the
marshaled host as any thing less than one vast machine
which a master-mind had formed, and a master-hand
was directing; and to have supposed that a single
soldier could have found distinction, or acquired note,
unless by some excessive crime, or excessive courage,
would be like identifying a drop in the ocean, or expecting
some particle of matter to assert and confirm
its indisputable right to distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All heard of the progress and the victories of the
army, but none knew exactly who were included in that
little sentence, “one thousand killed and wounded;”
and the heart of Louise sunk within her as occasional
bulletins of battles reached the village, with statements
of daring courage, of admirable conduct, and of numerous
deaths. Letters were then not common from
the army, at least from private soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed, and Louise obtained permission of her
mother to visit a relative at a distance; it was deemed
a good opportunity to repair her health and spirits by
a change of scenery and of company; and so she left
her mother with more than usual evidence of grief at
departure, for Louise, though affectionate, was not
timid, and she rarely anticipated danger in any undertaking
of her own; and such was her self-possession,
that she never suffered from any of those incidents of
travel which so often disturb the nerves of more delicate
persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A battle had been fought, and a German city yielded
to the arms of the French. The wounded were disposed
of in the hospitals, churches, and hotels of the
conquered city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph lay stretched out upon a well prepared bed
in a small chamber, quite apart from some of his
wounded brethren. A musket-ball had passed through
his body, escaping the vital parts, but producing a
wound which it was feared would, from the lack of
regular attendants, and the warmth of the weather,
prove mortal. He had suffered much, and his system
was not in a condition to aid nature; still he rather
improved. One morning, while he lay ruminating on
the change in his affairs, he saw the surgeon of the
regiment entering the room, followed by a young,
slightly-built person, who seemed to have very little
of the military in his movements or his dress; his face,
for a moment, sent back the thoughts of Adolph to the
home of his boyhood and youth; he started, as if some
sudden pain had seized him, but looking again, he heard
the name of the stranger announced. It was Klemm;
he was the secretary to the general commanding the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come,” said Klemm, sitting down beside
the bed of Adolph, “to assist in taking care of some of
our wounded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of <span class='it'>our</span> wounded,” said Adolph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>our</span> wounded; for, though my pronunciation
is rather German than French, I am a native and a
citizen of France, educated in Germany, and bearing
in my speech pretty strong proofs of my master’s
powers of instruction, and my own of imitation. I have
left some of the volunteer nurses with others, and have
come to do my best by you. I have some acquaintance
with the art. Is this your dog?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, this is Ponto the second; his predecessor,
whom I brought from the village with me, perished in
the same action in which his master received his present
wound; and long used to the company of a faithful
dog, I procured this, the nearest resemblance to old
Ponto that I could find, and have christened him after
his predecessor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And transferred your affections from the old to the
new companion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not entirely yet, but nearly, I think; he is likely
to inherit the love as well as the name of the deceased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love is a quality easily transferred, then?” said
Klemm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes; we soldiers, who are quartered in
favorable positions, do certainly find it a convertible
commodity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will dress your wound,” said Klemm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the office had been performed, and Adolph
was settled quietly down upon his well beaten pillow,
Klemm said, “It is now time for me to repair to my
duties at head-quarters, and you would better compose
yourself to sleep. Do you need the assistance of a
chaplain as well as a nurse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To confess the truth,” said Adolph, “I believe I
could about as well dress my wound myself, as to go
over some of those troublesome prayers with which
my boyhood was unutterably bored. I think, however,
that a little sleep would be about as refreshing
as prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
Just as Klemm was withdrawing, Adolph called
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I understand that you are to act as assistant
surgeon or nurse in this building?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I think I shall recover, for I have felt no
dressing like this since I was shot; and probably in a
few weeks we may have a frolic together, for I perceived
as they brought me hither that the place is not
wholly destitute of females.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considerable familiarity grew up between the
wounded man and his nurse. The exceeding delicacy
of the attentions of Klemm, his soothing care, his
skillful application of all the prescriptions of the surgeon,
created in Adolph a spirit of gratitude which
then found expression in words, but which he hoped
would have other exponents at a future time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you wear a token,” said Klemm, as he took
hold of the medal which had been placed round the
neck of the soldier. “I should think that one who
wore this would not fail in his daily devotions. Or is
this a love token?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, rather more of love than religion, I imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then your heart has suffered as much as your
body?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why that might be the token of another’s love for
me, rather than of mine for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true, indeed; the medal itself might have
been bestowed as a token of love for you; but surely,
if worn by you, it was worn as a token of love for
another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, to say the truth, it has been worn without
much thought any way; but if you will look at it, you
will see that it has saved my life by breaking the force
of a ball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has certainly suffered considerably,” said Klemm,
as he gazed at the crushed medal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is strange,” said Klemm, some days afterward,
when dressing the wounds of Adolph, “that you should
wear a religious medal on your neck, and appear to be
inattentive to services for which such things are worn,
and even indifferent to the motives for which this particular
one was given.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the motive?” said Adolph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me some days since, that it was rather
a token of love than religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In which I think it proper to say I was wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You awaken in me a curiosity by your remarks
which I certainly have no right to expect will be
gratified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph, whose fault of character it was to yield to
immediate influences, professed himself willing to explain,
desiring it to be understood, however, that the
names he should use with regard to the absent, should
be fictitious. “My own follies are justly visited on
me, but I have no right to connect respectable names
with mine in this situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph, changing the name of the village and that of
Madam Berien’s family, related to Klemm the circumstances
of his life—his love for Louise, his irreligious
habits, his restoration to propriety, his call to the army,
and added that the evil associations of the camp had
obliterated not only the sense of respect which he
had begun to feel for religion, but it had really led him
back to skepticism; and his life in the army had of late
been in accordance with his want of belief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Klemm, “you retain your affection
for things and persons of this world, notwithstanding
your loss of belief in the doctrines that relate to
that which is to come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not entirely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ceased to love Louise—do you love
another?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither; but I confess to you that as I released
myself from the trammels which the religious opinions
of Louise placed upon my mind and conduct, I felt less
respect, and consequently less love for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does your respect and love go together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My love for her was almost entirely dependent on
respect. She was my superior in education, my teacher
in religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so she put on airs, did she—played the school-mistress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should certainly do injustice to her were I to
admit the force of your query. She led me back into
religious observances less by any thing masculine in
her character than by the evident disinterestedness of
her conduct, and the conviction that however little I
might respect the requirements of religion, I certainly
found the results of the outward observances of the
rules the best for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you still love Louise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I love her, and live as I have lived for these
last six months? I ask seriously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will answer <span class='it'>that</span> when I can ascertain how intimately
your self-respect is connected with that respect
which you say was the fount of your love for Louise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is certain that for some months after I entered
the army, my resolutions for good were well maintained,
and I thought that my affections for Louise were
augmented by absence. But I fell into the habits of
those with whom I associated, and I soon found that
they shared the opinions which my earlier companions
professed; and I confess to you that my old skepticism
returned, and though my sufferings here have certainly
prevented me from the indulgence of dissipation into
which I had fallen, yet I do not find that my religious
belief has returned with my change of conduct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably not, your change of conduct, as you call
it, is only the necessity of your position, and you have
perhaps sinned as heartily here, within sight of death,
as when you were in the full flush of health.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, by the way, Mr. Klemm, that is the unkindest
remark you have made to me yet, and smacking the
least of German accent of any sentence you have
uttered. How much your voice resembles Louise’s!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I resemble her much in other respects?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not as tall, and you are darker; beside,
your shock of hair resembles her splendid head about
as much as your guttural German does her pure
French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adolph,” said Klemm, in accents far more <span class='it'>Germanic</span>
than those recently used, “would you seek to
renew your relations with Louise if you were now
permitted to return?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only weakness which I ever knew in Louise
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
was her love for me, and that, I have occasion to know,
would not allow her to marry me with my present
vices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you not conform to the customs of her family
without a change of opinion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you advise me to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Klemm, you have seen too much of my character
for me to affect to conceal much from you. I repeat
it, I do not find myself disposed to any sanctimonious
display of piety; I cannot and will not submit myself
to the mortifying sacraments of the church. But if I
could play the hypocrite, I would not deceive Louise
if I could; and I suppose it is an evidence of my want
of love for her now, that I will not do this to secure
her as my wife. What say you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will answer you to-morrow,” said Klemm, as he
hastily left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All gone! all impressions of piety erased, all holy
resolutions abandoned, all faith shipwrecked, all progress
given up, all religion relinquished; yet what is
that last sentiment he utters, ‘I would not deceive her
even to make her my wife.’ Surely while the sentiments
of religion are clouded, while their effect is
denied, they are lying deep in the heart, buried, but
not lost—silent, unseen, but surely not dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph was recovering slowly, and his nurse sought
to comfort him with the assurance that he would soon
be allowed to return home upon a furlough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I desire to return home,” said Adolph,
“a wreck of what I have been—a wreck in mind and
body, my health ruined and my faith destroyed? I
take back nothing which caused my departure to be
regretted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have heard, then, that Louise, apprised of your
situation, has resolved to discard you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have not heard it, but I feel it; and, moreover,
I cannot and will not impose upon her faith
in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think if you could resolve to resume your religious
duties there, notwithstanding all that has
passed here, though she should know it all, she
would receive you. But shall I invite a priest into
your room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To have me laughed at by the whole regiment. I
have little to confess that I have not told you—nothing,
indeed, that you may not fully understand by what
I have said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have no functions to grant absolution, whatever
you may confess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has any one more than you have? Is not the
whole system one of priestcraft? What do priests
know more than I do, and for what are they seeking to
bring me under their care, unless to augment their
power, and increase their comforts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you have an inclination to listen to
teachers of another creed? They are in the next
town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, they are all alike in one thing, however
they may differ in other matters, to rule others and
help themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was Father Rudolph of that class?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, apparently not—but how do <span class='it'>you</span> know Father
Rudolph? Or how did you know that I was acquainted
with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Klemm bit his lip—“It is not difficult to ascertain
who have been your friends, as in your delirium you
were very free with their names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I repeat <span class='it'>her</span> name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only as Louise. But you are apparently set against
the clergy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you thought really of their influence on your
life? Have you considered that much of all that you
call morals is indeed the effect of their religious teaching?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is <span class='it'>religion</span> not the <span class='it'>priest</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak for the <span class='it'>instrument</span>, I confess; but a clergyman
is to religion what an army is to a <span class='it'>war</span>—and
you might as well think of conducting a national contest
without officer and soldier, as a moral, religious contest
without a clergy. And I doubt whether you have
any idea of religion, unless it be a sort of restraint upon
certain actions and passions. You mean morals when
you say religion, and as you have seen morals exist
where there was no profession of religion or observance
of prescribed devotion, you think that such a
morality is an independent system. Let me correct
that idea. I agree that we find morals without religion,
but I do not agree that morals would exist without
it, and thousands of our young officers (I heard
some of them last evening,) assert with philosophic
gravity, that they are moral (they mean good) without
religion. How vain—how short-sighted. They overlook
the great fact that their morals are good habits
founded on the religious teachings and practice of their
mothers or priests, and that all the credit which they
claim for their philosophy is due to Christianity, and
that less settled in habits, or less reflective than they
now are, they would fall with the first temptation that
presented. What do you say to that Adolph?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say nothing now—proceed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will proceed to make a personal application. To
whom was the virtue of your childhood and youth
due? Certainly to your virtuous, religious mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know my mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a question!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If not, how did you know that she was religious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you said that in your childhood you were
religious and had a mother. You gave me a knowledge
of the cause when you stated the effect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my mother was neither a <span class='it'>priest</span> nor a <span class='it'>religeuse</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but she frequented the sacrament of the church,
and attended to the instruction of a priest, and thus became
<span class='it'>religious</span>. But you admit that falling into bad
company your morals became, if not depraved, at
least vitiated, and that you began to despise religion
when you neglected morals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when I began to reform, certainly I did not
owe my change of purpose to a priest, and I only intended
the reformation in my morals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom then were you indebted for moral improvement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Louise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did not Louise owe her instruction to the same
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
priest whom you had neglected? Nay, is it not probable
that she applied to Father Rudolph for advice in
the very matter of your reformation, and that he prescribed
the condition on which she was to indulge her
affections and encourage yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot say that it was not so. But Louise was
pretty independent in her manners, and would scarcely
have asked the priest’s advice with regard to a lover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know any thing temporal of greater consequence
than matrimonial engagements, or any relation
more likely to have effect upon what you seem to
think the priest has a legitimate right to meddle
with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not believe the priest interfered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>know</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is most natural that he should have done it. And
now permit me to suggest still further, that while you
owe the lessons which Louise gave you to the good
father, you owe the reformation which you commenced
to the remains of religious instruction in your
heart. Undoubtedly it was your love to Louise that
gave her influence over you, but it was religion that
made her efforts successful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You confuse me—I do not assent, but I cannot now
contend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will leave you—leave you with this single remark,
that not only did you owe your former reformation
to religion, but there is religion now dealing with
your heart, and your affection for Louise will return
with the ready admission of religious instruction and
the performance of religious duties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I love her now as well as ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall hear more to-morrow of your experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was one of nervous irritability, and poor
Adolph presented to the surgeon the next morning, one
of the worst cases of relapse in the hospital, and Klemm
was early summoned to the room of his patient. The
day was passed in painful aberration of mind, and short
unrefreshing sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening found the sufferer somewhat relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do for you more?” said Klemm, as he
smoothed down the pillow after assisting Adolph to
acquire a comfortable position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That voice again!” said Adolph, “and no German.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have got clear of my German accent by conversing
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only at times,” said Adolph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I do nothing more for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, I believe.—Did you prepare for the
priesthood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I had neither inclination nor vocation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adolph you are very sick—sick, less from the pain
of your wound than from the tumult of your mind. I
am unable to assist you. Let me invite in a clergyman,
who is in the hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there any here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One. The terrible state of the wounded in some
of the wards has compelled the officer to admit a
priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there contagious disease?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not fear for yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Die vollige Liebe treibet die Furcht aus.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember the words. I will call in the clergyman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And before Adolph could either consent or refuse
Klemm had left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time a priest entered the chamber of
Adolph, and proceeded to make himself acquainted
with the state of his penitent’s mind, and then to attend
to the duties of his sick call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph was calm and settled when Klemm returned,
but not communicative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Klemm then announced his departure a duty, and the
fact that Adolph would, as soon as his strength would
permit, be allowed to return home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parting of the friends that evening was truly
affecting. Klemm was made to promise a visit to the
village—“Though,” said he, “I may make an impression
on Louise unfavorably to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not fear that,” said Adolph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Die vollige Liebe treibet die Furcht aus</span>,” said
Klemm. “A German quotation which I will show you
in the original, or at least explain to you when we
meet in your village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Klemm took leave of Adolph and Ponto, the faithful
dog, and proceeded on his journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men gather to see a regiment, a single company, or
even a little squad depart for the camp—but few look
out for the returning wounded—they come back singly
and sorrowful. The wagon that was passing the ferry
house nearly opposite the village in which resided
Madam Berien, stopped for a moment, and a soldier,
war-worn and wounded, stepped slowly from the vehicle,
followed by his dog. He entered the house, and
as he closed the door upon a small parlor, he found
himself confronted by a female.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adolph!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—all well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Ponto,” too, said Louise, as the affectionate
dog, after reconnoitering round her, sprang up to receive
his share of the caresses—“Ponto, too, come
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But this is not Ponto that left the village with
me. How comes he to be so familiar with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your wounds are better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am well nearly. I need only rest—only your
kindness, and I shall be ready for another campaign,”
said he with a melancholy smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat awaited the passengers, and a few on the
opposite shore were waiting for the</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Conscript’s Return</span>.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph was received by the villagers on the shore
with hearty welcome, and was conducted toward his
former residence. As he entered the little hamlet, he
turned slowly into the church, and at the foot of the
humble altar poured out to Heaven the thanks which
swelled up in his heart for his return. And near him
one heart gushing with love and gratitude was breathing
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>
out its thanksgiving that the wanderer had first
sought the house of God.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i018.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0002' style='width:85%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='bold'>THE RETURN.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The post-office the next day supplied a letter, without
post-mark, giving Adolph an officer’s commission
for the gallantry that saved his colonel’s life at the
imminent risk of his own, and extending his furlough
for a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Louise,” said Adolph, “how your complexion
has suffered since I saw you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been absent for some weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and these mountain relatives of yours always
look of about the same color as one of their ripe grapes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolph having now some position, and a source of
reliance upon his good resolution, presented himself
before Madam Berien to solicit formally the hand of
her daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The matter <span class='it'>had</span> evidently occupied the worthy lady’s
attention, as she consented at once, referred to an early
day for the marriage, and desired that her own house
might be the residence of her son-in-law and his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely, Providence is too good to me,” said
Adolph, when he announced to Louise the result of
his negotiation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has it ever failed you when you really relied upon
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did it not allow me to be sent to the army, and to
suffer horribly? I do believe I should have died without
Klemm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has not your campaign resulted in the adoption of
a sounder code of morals, a restoration to religious
exercises, and the acquisition of rank, and in our almost
immediate marriage? And will not Klemm be
here at our wedding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, but faith Klemm is such a well-made
handsome little fellow, that I might wish him to tarry
until after our marriage. I should not like to find him
and you chatting German sentiment together in the
German language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not, Adolph?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might <span class='it'>fear</span> that the sleek little secretary would
outshine the wounded lieutenant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear, Adolph! You would not <span class='it'>fear</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked he, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Die vollige Liebe treibet die Furcht aus</span>,” said
Louise, with a strong German accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Heaven, Louise! where did you find that
quotation, and where that accent and look?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the quotation is from the Bible, and the accent
is as true German as my grape-raising relatives
know how to give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No Klemm arrived as Adolph hoped, and so the
bridal party set forward to the church where Father
Rudolph was awaiting their arrival. The simple but
interesting ceremony was concluded, and as the party
rose from their last genuflection toward the altar,
Louise whispered into her husband’s ear:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Klemm has come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where—where is he? Oh! how I long to have
him share in the happiness which I enjoy, and he <span class='it'>will</span>
share in it, for it is of his own producing. Oh! Louise,
could you but know—but I have told you all I can
tell; yet I cannot express what I feel for that young
man’s beautiful devotion to my good—to him alone,
next to God, am I indebted for this day’s unspeakable
delight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you owed it to <span class='it'>me</span>,” said Louise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To you—to you indeed, that you are mine—but to
him that I was made worthy of your acceptance.
Dear Louise, I am <span class='it'>afraid</span> you must share—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid, Adolph—‘<span class='it'>Die vollige Liebe treibet die
Furcht aus.</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Louise, you confound me—whose is that tone of
voice—whose that arch look? Surely you are not
yourself now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this moment, Adolph. Just <span class='it'>now</span> I am
Klemm!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sacrifices of Louise had been accepted in
Heaven—of course they were appreciated on earth,
and “perfect love which casteth out fear,” had lured
the wanderer back to religion, and had been rewarded
in its good performed and the power of doing good.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>Ask any thing but that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour had not quite passed, when, as she sat alone
in her little gayly-decorated study, with its walls hung
with water-color drawings of her own execution, its
tables strewn with poetry and music of her own composition,
and her favorite books, and her own lute—her
little study in which the happiest hours of her
life had been spent, the first hours of her married life,
while Jasper was all that her fancy painted him—his
step came along the corridor, but with a slow and
hesitating sound, most unlike to the quick, firm, decided
tread, for which he was remarkable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She noticed the difference, it is true, at the moment,
but forgot it again instantly. It was enough! It was
he! and he was coming once again to seek her in
her own apartment; he had a boon to ask of her—he
had promised to love her—he had called her “his
dear Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now she sprung up, with her soul beaming from
her eyes, and ran to meet him. The door was opened
ere he reached it, and as he entered, she fell upon his
neck, and wound her snowy arms about his waist, and
kissed him fifty times, and wept silent tears in the fullness
of her joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And did not his heart respond in the least to her
innocent and girlish rapture; did he not bend at all
from his bad purpose; was there no melting, no relenting
in that callous, selfish nature; was, indeed, all
within him hard as the nether millstone?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clasped her, he caressed her, he spoke to her
fondly, lovingly, he kissed, like Judas, to betray. He
suffered her to lead him to his favorite seat of old, the
deep, softly-cushioned, low arm-chair, and to place her
footstool by his side, and nestle herself down upon it
as she used to do, with her arms folded negligently
across his knee, and her beautiful rounded chin propped
upon them, with her great earnest eyes looking
up in his face, like unfathomable wells of tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he returned her gaze of fondness, unabashed,
unembarrassed; and yet it was sometime before he
spoke; and when he did speak at length, his voice was
altered and almost husky. But it was from doubt how
best he might play his part, not that he shrunk from the
task he had imposed upon himself, either for shame or
for pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my Theresa,” he said, at last, “have you
thought whether you will make this sacrifice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Jasper, I have not thought about it; but if you
wish me to make it, I will make it, and it will be no
sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I tell you, Theresa, that it is a sacrifice, a
mighty and most painful sacrifice; a sacrifice so great
and so terrible, that I almost fear, almost feel that it
would be selfish in me to ask it of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask it, then; ask it quickly, that you may see how
readily it shall be granted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you conceive no sacrifice that you would not
make to please me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, that you would ask of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Theresa, no one can say what another <span class='it'>might</span> ask
of them. Husbands, lovers, brothers, have asked
strange sacrifices—fearful sacrifices, at woman’s hands;
and—they have been made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask me, then, ask me,” she repeated, smiling,
although her face had grown somewhat pale as she
listened to his words, and marked his strangely excited
manner. “I repeat, there is <span class='it'>no</span> sacrifice which you
would ask of me, which I will not make. Nay more,
there is none which I should think a sacrifice if it is
to preserve your love to me, when I feared that I had
lost it forever, though how, indeed, I knew not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see,” he said, affecting to muse with
himself, and ponder deeply. “We shall see; you are
a great historian, and have read of all the celebrated
women of times past and present. You have heard of
the beautiful Mademoiselle Desvieux, she who⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She who was the promised wife of the great, the
immortal Bossuet; and who sacrificed her own happiness,
freeing her lover from the claims she held on
him, lest a wife should be a clog upon his pure yet
soaring ambition, lest an earthly affection should wean
him from a higher love, and weaken the cords that
were drawing him toward heaven! I have—I have
heard of her! Who has not—who does not revere
her name—who does not love her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what think you of her sacrifice, Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That it was her duty. A difficult duty to perform,
you will say, but still her duty. Her praise is, that
she performed it gloriously. And yet I doubt not that
her sacrifice bore her its own exceeding great reward.
Loving as she loved, all her sorrows must have been
changed into exultation, when she saw him in after days
the saint he became, the saint she helped to make him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And could you have made such a sacrifice,
Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, and I think so,” she replied, with a little
hesitation. “But it avails not now to think of that,
seeing that I cannot make such. She was a maiden, I
am a wedded wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, dearest, true. I only named her, to judge
by your opinion, of what I wish to learn, ere I will ask
you. There was another sacrifice, Theresa, a very
terrible sacrifice, made of late, and made to no purpose,
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
too, as it fell out—a sacrifice of far more doubtful
nature; yet there be some who have not failed to
praise it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it—do you praise it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least I pity it, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it—tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After the late rebellion at Sedgemoor. Have you
not heard, Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think not—go on, I want to hear it; go on,
Jasper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a young man, a cavalier, very young,
very brave, very nobly born, and, it is said, very handsome.
He was taken after the route of that coward,
Gray of Werk’s horse—cast into prison, and, when his
turn came, tried by the butcher, Kirke—you know what
that means, Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Condemned,” she said, sadly. “Of course he was
condemned—what next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be hung by the neck upon the shameful gibbet,
and then cut down, while yet alive, and subjected to
all the barbarous tortures which are inflicted as the
penalty of high treason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horrible! horrible! and—what more, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you not, indeed, heard the tale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, no. I pray you tell me, for you have
moved me very deeply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very moving. The boy had a sister—the
loveliest creature, it is said, that trod the soil of England,
scarce seventeen years of age, a very paragon of
grace and purity and beauty. They two were alone
in the world—parents, kinsfolk, friends, they had none.
They had none to love but one another, even as we,
my Theresa; and they did love—how, you may judge.
The girl threw herself at the butcher’s feet, and implored
her brother’s pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, go on, Jasper!” cried the young wife, excited
almost beyond the power of restraining her emotions
by the dreadful interest of his tale, “and, for
once, he granted it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, for once, as you say, he granted it. But
upon one condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that was—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that was, that the young girl should make a
sacrifice—an awful sacrifice—should submit, in a word,
to be a martyr for her brother’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To die for him—and she died! Of course, she
died to save him; that were <span class='it'>no</span> sacrifice, none, Jasper—I
say none! Why <span class='it'>any</span> woman would have done
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not to die for him—it was to sacrifice herself—herself—for
she was lovely, as I told you—to the
butcher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” sighed Theresa, with a terrible sensation at
her heart, which she could not explain, even to herself;
“and what—what did she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She asked permission to consult her brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he told her that he had rather die ten thousand
deaths than that she should lose one hair’s breadth
of her honor!” cried Theresa, enthusiastically clasping
her hands together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he told her that life was very sweet, and death
on a gallows very shameful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The catiff! the miserable, <a id='loath'></a>loathsome slave! the
filthy dastard! I trust that Kirke drew him with wild
horses! The gallows were too good for such a slave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then <span class='it'>you</span> would not have made such a sacrifice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span>—I!” she exclaimed, her soft blue eyes actually
flashing fire; “I sacrifice my honor! but lo!” she interrupted
herself, smiling at her own vehemence, “am
not I a little fool, to fancy that you are in earnest. No,
dearest Jasper, I would no more make <span class='it'>that</span> sacrifice,
than you would suffer me to do so. Did not I make
that reservation, did I not say any sacrifice, which you
would ask of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, dearest!” he replied gently, laying his hand
on her head, “you do me no more than justice there.
I would die as many deaths as I have hairs on my
head, before you should so save me.” And for the
first time that night Jasper St. Aubyn spoke in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you would, Jasper. But go on, I pray
you, with this fearful tale. I would you had not begun
it; but now you have, I must hear it to the end.
What did she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did, Theresa, as her brother bade her. She
sacrificed herself to the butcher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor wretch! poor wretch! and so her brother
lived with the world’s scorn and curses on his head—and
she—did she <span class='it'>die</span>, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my Theresa. She is alive yet. It was the
brother died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so? how could that be? Did Kirke then
relent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kirke never relented! When the girl awoke in
the butcher’s chamber, with fame and honor—all that
she loved in life—lost to her for ever—he bade her look
out of the window—what think you she saw there,
Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thing, that an hour before was her brother,
dangling in the accursed noose from the gibbet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And God did not speak in thunder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the girl’s mind, He spoke—for that went astray
at once, jangled and jarred, and out of tune forever!
<span class='it'>There</span> was a sacrifice, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wicked one, and so it ended, wickedly. We’ll
none of such sacrifices, Jasper. If we should ever
have to die, which God avert in his mercy, any death
of violence or horror, we will die tranquilly and together.
Will we not, dearest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you said but now, may the good God guard us
from such a fate, Theresa; and yet,” he added, looking
at her fixedly, and with a strange expression, “we
may be nearer to it than we think for, even now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearer to what, Jasper? speak,” she cried, eagerly,
as if she had missed the meaning of the words he last
uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearer to the perils of the law, for high treason,”
answered her husband, in a low, dejected voice. “It
is of that I have been anxious to speak with you all
the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then speak at once, for God’s sake, dearest
Jasper! speak at once, and fully, that we may know
the worst;” and she showed more composure now, in
what she naturally deemed the extremity of peril, than
he had looked for, judging from the excitement she had
manifested at the mere listening to the story of another’s
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
perils. “Say on,” she added, seeing that he
hesitated, “let me know the worst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be so, though it is hard to tell, Theresa;
we—myself, I mean, and a band of the first and noblest
youths of England—have been engaged for these three
months past in a conspiracy to banish from the throne
of England this last and basest son of a weak, bigoted,
unlucky race of kings—this cowardly, blood-thirsty,
persecuting bigot—this Papist monarch of a Protestant
land, this James the Second, as men call him; and to
set in his place the brave, wise, virtuous William of
Nassau, now Stadtholder of the United Provinces. It
is this business which has obliged me to be absent so
often of late, in London. It is the failure of this business
which has rendered me morose, unkind, irritable—need
I say more, you have pardoned me, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The failure of this business!” she exclaimed, gazing
at him with a face from which dismay had banished
every hue of color—“the failure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, Theresa, it is even so. Had we succeeded in
liberating England from the cold tyrant’s bloody yoke,
we had been patriots, saviors, fathers of our country—Brutuses,
for what I know, and Timoleons! We have
failed—therefore, we are rebels, traitors and, I suppose,
ere long shall be victims.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The plot, then, is discovered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how long, Jasper, have you known this dreadful
termination?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have foreseen it these six weeks or more. I
knew it, for the first time, to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is it absolutely known, divulged, proclaimed?
Have arrests been made?” she asked, with a degree of
coolness that amazed him, while he felt that it augured
ill for the success of his iniquitous scheme; but he had,
in some sort, foreseen her questions, and his answers
were prepared already. He answered, therefore, as
unhesitatingly as if there had been one word of truth
in all that he was uttering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is <span class='it'>all</span> known to one of the leading ministers of
the government; it is not divulged; and no arrests have
been made yet. But the breathing space will be brief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All, then, is easy! Let us fly! Let us take horse
at once—this very night! By noon to-morrow, we
shall be in Plymouth, and thence we can gain France,
and be safe there until this tyranny shall be o’erpast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brave girl!” he replied, with the affectation of a
melancholy smile. “Brave Theresa, you would bear
exile, ruin, poverty with the outlawed traitor; and we
might still be happy. But, alas, girl! it is too late to
fly. The ports are all closed throughout England. It
is too late to fly, and to fight is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it remains only that we die!” she exclaimed,
casting herself into his arms, “and that is not so difficult,
now that I know you love me, Jasper.” But, even as
she uttered the words, his previous conversation recurred
to her mind, and she started from his arms,
crying out, “but you spoke of a sacrifice!—a sacrifice
which I could make! Is it possible that I can save you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not me alone, Theresa, but all the band of brothers
who are sworn to this emprise; nor them alone,
but England, which may, by your deed, still be liberated
from the tyrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her beautiful eyes upward, and her lips
moved rapidly, although she spoke not. She was
praying for aid from on high—for strength to do her
duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her with calm, expectant, unmoved eyes,
and muttered to himself, “I have gained. She will
yield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” she said, “now,” as her prayer was ended,
“I am strong now to bear. Tell me, Jasper, what
must I do to save you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot tell you, dearest. I cannot—it is too
much—you could not make it; nor if <span class='it'>you</span> would, could
I. Let it pass. We will die—all die together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And England!” exclaimed the girl, with her face
kindling gloriously; “and our mother England, must
she perish by inches in the tyrant’s clutch, because we
are cowards? No, Jasper, no. Be of more constant
mind. Tell me, what is it I must do? and, though it
wring my heart and rack my brain, if I <span class='it'>can</span> save you
and your gallant friends, and our dear native land, I
will save them, though it kill me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you endure to part from me, Theresa—to
part from me forever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To part from you, Jasper!” No written phrase
can express the agony, the anguish, the despair, which
were made manifest in every sound of those few
simple words. A breaking heart spoke out in every
accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, to part from me, never to see me more—never
to hear my voice; only to know that I exist, and that
I love you—love you beyond my own soul! Could
you do this, Theresa, in the hope of a meeting hereafter,
where no tyranny should ever part us any more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not—I know not!” she exclaimed, in a
shrill, piercing tone, most unlike her usual soft, slow
utterance. “Is this the sacrifice you spoke of? Would
this be called for at my hands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To part from me so utterly that it should not be
known or suspected that we had ever met—ever been
wedded?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Jasper,” she cried, starting, and gazing at
him wildly, “<span class='it'>that</span> were impossible; all the world
knows that we have met—that we have lived together
here—that I <span class='it'>am</span> your wife. What do you mean? Are
you jesting with me? No, no! God help me! that resolute,
stern, dark expression! No, no, no, no! Do
not frown on me, Jasper; but keep me not in this suspense—only
tell me, Jasper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole world—that is to say, the whole world
of villagers and peasants here, do know that we have
met—that we have lived together; but they do not
<span class='it'>know</span>—nay, more, they do not <span class='it'>believe</span>, that you <span class='it'>are</span>
my wife, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not your wife—not your wife! What, in God’s
name, then, do they believe me to be? But I <span class='it'>am</span>—I <span class='it'>am</span>—yes,
before God and man, I <span class='it'>am</span> your wife, Jasper St.
Aubyn! That shame will I never bear. The parish
register will prove it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before God, dearest, most assuredly you <span class='it'>are</span> my
wife; but before man, I grieve to say, it is not so; nor
will the register, to which you appeal—as I did, when
I first heard the scandal—prove any thing, but against
you. It seems the rascal sexton cut out the record of
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
our marriage from the register, so soon as the old
rector died. He is gone, so that he can witness nothing.
Alderly and the sexton will not speak, for to do so
would implicate themselves in the guilt of having mutilated
the church-register. Alderly’s mother is an
idiot. We can <span class='it'>prove</span> nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when did you learn all this, Jasper?” she
asked, calmly; for a light, a fearful yet most clear
illumination began to dawn upon her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last night. And I rode down this morning to the
church, to inspect the register. It is as I was told;
there is no trace of the record which we signed, and
saw witnessed, on its pages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to what end should Verity and Alderly have
done this great crime needlessly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Villains themselves, they fancied that I too was a
villain; and that, if not then, at some after time, I should
desire to profit by their villainy, and should then be in
their power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!” she said, still maintaining perfect self-possession.
“It seems, at least, that their villainy was
wise, was prophetical.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Theresa!” his voice was stern, and harsh, and
threatening—his brow as black as midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me!” she said. “Pardon me, Jasper; but
you should make allowance for some feeling in a woman.
I am, then, looked upon as a lost, fallen wretch,
as a disgrace to my name and my sex, a concubine, a
harlot—is it not so, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! alas! Theresa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you would have me?—speak!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not have you do it; God knows! it goes
nigh to break my heart to think of it—I only tell you
what alone can save us—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand—it needs not to mince the matter;
what is it, then, that can save us—save <span class='it'>you</span>, I should
say rather, and <span class='it'>your</span> friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you should leave me, Theresa, and go where
you would, so it were not within a hundred miles of
this place—but better to France or Italy; all that wealth
could procure you, you should have; and my love
would be yours above all things, even although we
never meet, until we meet in heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven, sir, is for the innocent and faithful, not
for the liar and the traitor! But how shall this avail
any thing to save you, if I consent to do it? I must
know all; I must see all clearly, before I act.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you strong enough to bear what I shall say to
you, my poor Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Else had I not borne to hear what you <span class='it'>have</span> said
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the secretary of state, then, who has discovered
our plot. He is himself half inclined to join
us; but he is a weak, interested, selfish being, although
of vast wealth, great influence, and birth most noble.
Now, he has a daughter⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” the wretched girl started as if an ice-bolt had
shot to her very heart, “and you—you would wed
her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is to say, <span class='it'>he</span> would have me wed her; and
on that condition joins our party. And so our lives,
and England’s liberties, should be preserved by your
glorious sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must think, then—I must think,” she answered,
burying her head in her hands, in truth, to conceal the
agony of her emotions, and to gain time, not for deliberation,
but to compose her mind and clear her voice
for speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he stood gazing on her, with the cold, cutting
eye, the calm, sarcastic sneer, of a very Mephistopheles,
believing that she was about to yield, and inwardly
mocking the very weakness, on which he had played,
to his own base and cruel purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a moment she arose and confronted him, pale,
calm, majestical, most lovely in her extremity of
sorrow, but firm as a hero or a martyr.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so,” she said, in a clear, cold, ringing voice,
“this is the sacrifice you ask of me?—to sever myself
from you forever—to go forth into the great, cruel, cold
world alone, with a bleeding, broken heart, a blighted
reputation, and a blasted name? All this I might endure,
perhaps I would—but you have asked <span class='it'>more</span> of
me, Jasper. You have asked me to confess myself a
thing infamous and vile—a polluted wretch—not a
wife, but a wanton! You have asked <span class='it'>me</span>, your own
wedded wife, to write myself down, with my own
hand, a harlot, and to stand by and look on at your
marriage with another—as if I were the filthy thing
you would name me. Than be that thing, Jasper, I
would rather die a hundred fold; than call myself that
thing, being innocent of deed or thought of shame, I
had rather <span class='it'>be it</span>! Now, sir, are you answered? What,
heap the name of harlot on my mother’s ashes! What,
blacken my dead father’s stainless ’scutcheon! What—<span class='it'>lie</span>,
before my God, to brand myself, the first of an
honest line, with the strumpet’s stain of blackness!
Never! never! though thou and I, and all the youth of
England, were to die in tortures inconceivable; never!
though England were to perish unredeemed! Now,
sir, I ask you, are you answered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” he replied, perfectly unmoved, “I am answered,
Theresa, as I hoped, as I expected to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?—did you not ask me to do
this thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did <span class='it'>not</span>, Theresa. I told you what sacrifice
might save us all. I did <span class='it'>not</span> ask you to make it. Nay,
did I not tell you that I would not even suffer you to
make it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you told me—you told me—God help me, for
I think I shall go mad! Oh! tempt me no further,
Jasper; try me no further. Is—is this true, that you
have told me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every word—every word of it, my own best love,”
answered the arch deceiver, “save only that I would
not for my life, nay, for my soul, have suffered you to
make the sacrifice I spoke of. Perish myself, my
friends! perish England! nay, perish the whole earth,
rather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why so tempt me? Why so sorely, so
cruelly try this poor heart, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To learn if you were strong enough to share in my
secrets—and you shall share them. We must fly,
Theresa; not from Plymouth; not from any seaport,
but from the wildest gorge in the wild coast of Devon.
I have hired a fishing-boat to await us. We must ride
forth alone, as if for a pleasure party, across the hills,
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>
to-morrow, and so make our way to the place appointed.
If we escape, all shall be well—come the
worst, as you said, my own Theresa, at least we shall
die together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you in earnest, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On my soul! by the God who hears me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you <span class='it'>will</span> take me with you; you will not cast
me from you; you will uphold me ever to be your
own, your wedded wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will—I will. Not for the universe! not for my
own soul! would I lose you, my own, own Theresa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he clasped her to his bosom, in the fondest,
closest embrace, and kissed her beautiful lips eagerly,
passionately. And she, half fainting in his arms, could
only murmur, in the revulsion of her feelings, “Oh,
happy! happy! too, too happy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he released her from his arms, and bade her
go to bed, for it was waxing late, and she would need
a good night’s rest to strengthen her for the toils of to-morrow’s
journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she smiled on him, and prayed him not to tarry
long ere he joined her; and retired, still agitated and
nervous from the long continuance of the dreadful
mental conflict to which he had subjected her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he, when she had left the room, turned almost
instantly as pale as ashes—brow, cheeks, nay, his very
lips were white and cold. The actor was exhausted
by his own exertions. The man shrunk from the task
which was before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worse for her!” he muttered, through his
hard-set teeth, “the worse for her! the obstinate, vain,
willful fool! I would, by heaven! I would have saved
her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he clasped his burning brow with the fingers
of his left hand, as if to compress its fierce, rapid
beating, and strode to and fro, through the narrow
room, working the muscles of his clinched right hand,
as if he grasped the hilt of sword or dagger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no other way,” he said at length; “there
is no other way, and I <span class='it'>must</span> do it—must do it with
my own hand. But—can I—can I—?—” he paused
a moment, and resumed his troubled walk. Then
halted, and muttered in a deep voice, “By hell! there
is naught that a man cannot do; and I—am I not a
man, and a right resolute, and stout one? It shall be
so—it is her fate! her fate! Did not her father speak
of it that night, as I lay weak and wounded on the bed?
did I not dream it thrice thereafter, in that same bed?
though then I understood it not. It shall be there—even
there—where I saw it happen; so shall it pass
for accident. It is fate!—who can strive against their
fate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he was silent, and during that momentary
pause, a deep, low, muttering roar was heard in the
far distance—a breathless hush—and again, that long,
hollow, crashing roll, that tells of elemental warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper’s eye flashed, and his whole face glared with
a fearful and half frenzied illumination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span>,” he cried, “it <span class='it'>is</span> thunder! From point to
point it is true! It is her fate—her fate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with the words, he rushed from the room; and
within ten minutes, was folded in the rapturous embrace
of the snowy arms of her, whose doom of
death he had decreed already in the secrets of his
guilty soul.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Throughout that livelong night, the thunder roared
and rolled incessantly, and from moment to moment
the whole firmament seemed to yawn asunder, showing
its inner vaults, sheeted with living and coruscant
fire, while ever and anon long, arrowy, forked tongues,
of incandescent brightness, darted down from the
zenith, cleaving the massive storm-clouds with a crash
that made the whole earth reel and shudder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never, within the memory of man, had such a storm
been known at that season of the year. Huge branches,
larger than trees of ordinary size, were rent from the
gigantic oaks by the mere force of the hurricane, and
whirled away like straws before its fury. The rain
fell not in drops or showers, but in vast sheeted columns.
The rills were swollen into rivers, the rivers
covered the lowland meadows, expanded into very
seas. Houses were unroofed, steeples and chimneys
hurled in ruin to the earth, cattle were killed in the
open fields, unscathed by lightning, by the mere weight
of the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet through that awful turmoil of the elements,
which kept men waking, and bold hearts trembling
from the Land’s End to Cape Wrath, Jasper St. Aubyn
slept as calmly as an infant, with his head pillowed on
the soft bosom of his innocent and lovely wife. And
she, though the tempest roared around, and the thunder
crashed above her, so that she could not close an eye
in sleep; though she believed that to-morrow she was
about to fly from her native land, her home, never,
perhaps, to see them more; though she looked forward
to a life of toil and wandering, of hardship, and of
peril as an exile’s wife, perhaps to a death of horror, as
a traitor’s confederate, she blessed God with a grateful
heart, that he had restored to her her husband’s love,
and watched that dear sleeper, dreaming a waking
dream of perfect happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But him no dreams, either sleeping or waking, disturbed
from his heavy stupor, or diverted from his
hellish purpose. So resolute, so iron-like in its unbending
pertinacity was that young, boyish mind, that
having once resolved upon his action, not all the
terrors of heaven or of hell could have turned him
from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There lay beneath one roof, on one marriage bed,
ay, clasped in one embrace, the resolved murderer,
and his unconscious victim. And he had tasted the
honey of her lips, had fondled, had caressed her to the
last, had sunk to sleep, lulled by the sweet, low voice
of her who, if his power should mate his will, would
never look upon a second morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here, let no one say such things cannot be, save
in the fancy of the rhapsodist or the romancer; such
things are impossible—for not only is there nothing
under the sun impossible to human power, or beyond
the aim of human wickedness, but such things <span class='it'>are</span> and
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
have been, and will be again, so long as human passion
exists uncontrolled by principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such things have been among ourselves, and in our
own day, as he who writes has seen, and many of
those who read must needs remember—and such things
were that night at Widecomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the first dappling of the dawn, the rage of the
elements sunk into rest, the winds sighed themselves
to sleep, the pelting torrents melted into a soft, gray
mist; only the roar of the distant waters, mellowed
into a strange fitful murmur, was heard in the general
tranquillity which followed the loud uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wearied with her involuntary watching, Theresa
fell asleep also, still clasping in her fond arms the miserable,
guilty thing which she had sworn so fatally, and
kept her vow so faithfully, to love, honor, and obey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sun rose, the wretched man awoke from
his deep and dreamless deep; and as his eye fell on
that innocent, sweet face, calm as an infant’s, and
serene, though full of deep thoughts and pure affections,
he <span class='it'>did</span> start, he <span class='it'>did</span> shudder, for one second’s space—perhaps
for that fleeting point of time, he doubted. But
if it were so, he nerved himself again almost without an
effort, disengaged himself gently from the embrace of
her entwined arms, with something that sounded like
a smothered curse, and stalked away in sullen gloom,
leaving her buried in her last natural slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hours had, perhaps, gone over, and the morning
had come out bright and glorious after the midnight
storm, the atmosphere was clear and breezy, the skies
pure as crystal, and the glad sunshine glanced and
twinkled with ten thousand gay reflections in the diamond
rain-drops which still gemmed every blade of
grass, and glistened in every flowret’s cup, when
Theresa’s light step was heard coming down the stairs,
and her sweet voice inquiring where she should find
Master St. Aubyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am here,” answered his deep voice, which for
the moment he made an effort to inflect graciously, and
with the word he made his appearance from the door
of his study, booted to the mid-thigh, and spurred; with
a long, heavy rapier at his side, and a stout dagger
counterbalancing it in the other side of his girdle. He
was dressed in a full suit of plain black velvet, without
any ornament or embroidery; and whether it was that
the contrast made him look paler, or that the horror of
what he was about to do, though insufficient to turn his
hard heart, had sufficed to blanch his cheek and lips,
I know not, but, as she saw his face, Theresa started
as if she had seen a ghost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How pale you look, Jasper,” she said earnestly;
“are you ill at ease, dearest, or anxious about me?
If it be the last, vex not yourself, I pray you; for I am
not in the least afraid, either of the fatigue or of the
voyage. For the rest,” she added, with a bright smile,
intended to reassure him, “I have long wished to see
<span class='it'>la belle France</span>, as they call it; and to me the change
of scene, so long as you are with me, dearest Jasper,
will be but a change of pleasure. I hope I have not
kept you waiting. But I could not sleep during the
night for the thunder, and about daybreak I was overpowered
by a heavy slumber. I did not even hear you
leave me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw that you slept heavily, my own love,” he
made answer, “and was careful not to wake you,
knowing what you would have to undergo to-day, and
wishing to let you get all the rest you could before
starting. But come, let us go to breakfast. We have
little time to lose, the horses will be at the door in half
an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, then,” she answered, “I am ready;” and
she took his arm as she spoke, and passed, leaning on
him, through the long suit of rooms, which now, for
above a year had been her home in mingled happiness
and sorrow. “Heigho!” she murmured, with a half
sigh, “dear Widecomb! dear, dear Widecomb, many
a happy hour have I spent within your walls, and it
goes hard with me to leave you. I wonder, shall I
ever see you more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never,” replied the deep voice of her husband, in
so strange a tone, that it made her turn her head and
look at him quickly. A strange, dark spasm had convulsed
his face, and was not yet passed from it, when
her eye met his. She thought it was the effect of natural
grief at leaving his fine place—the place of his
birth—as an outlaw and an exile; and half repenting
that she had so spoken as to excite his feelings, she
hastened to soothe them, as she thought, by a gayer and
more hopeful word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never heed, dearest Jasper,” she said, pressing
his arm, on which she hung, “if we do love old Widecomb,
there are as fair places elsewhere, on the
world’s green face, and if there were not, happy minds
will aye find, or make happy places. And we, why
spite of time and tide, wind and weather, we <span class='it'>will</span> be
happy, Jasper. And I doubt not a moment, that we shall
yet live to spend happy days once more in Widecomb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear, never,” replied the young man, solemnly.
It was a singular feeling—he did not repent, he did not
falter or shrink in the least from his murderous purpose;
but, for his life, he could not give her a hope, he
could not say a word to cheer her, or deceive her,
further than he was compelled to do in order to carry
out his end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning meal passed silently and sadly; for,
in spite of all her efforts to be gay, and to make him
lighter-hearted, his brow was clouded, and he would
not converse; and she, fearing to vex him, or to trespass
on what she believed to be his deep regret at
leaving home, ceased to intrude upon his sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he asked her, “Are you ready?” and as
he spoke, arose from the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” she answered, “I am always ready when
you want me. And see, Jasper,” she added, “here
are my jewels,” handing him a small ebony casket
“I thought they might be of use to us, in case of our
wanting money; and yet I should grieve to part with
them, for they are the diamonds <span class='it'>you</span> gave me that
night we were wedded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took it with a steady hand, and thrust it into the
bosom of his dress, saying, with a forced smile, “You
are ever careful, Theresa. But you have said nothing,
I trust, to your maidens, of our going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely not, Jasper, they believe I am going but for
a morning’s ride. Do you not see that I have got on
my new habit? You have not paid me one compliment
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
on it, sir. I think you might at least have told
me that I looked pretty in it. I know the day when
you would have done so, without my begging it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that meant for a reproach, Theresa?” he said,
gloomily, “because—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A reproach, Jasper,” she interrupted him quickly,
“how little you understand poor me! I hoped, by my
silly prattle, to win you from your sorrow at leaving
all that you love so dearly. But I will be silent⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do so, I pray you, for the moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And without further words, he led her down the
steps of the terrace, and helped her to mount her
palfrey, a beautiful, slight, high-bred thing, admirably
fitted to carry a lady round the trim rides of a park,
but so entirely deficient in bone, strength, and sinew,
that no animal could have been conceived less capable
of enduring any continuous fatigue, or even of
making any one strong and sustained exertion. Then
he sprung to the back of his own noble horse, a tall,
powerful, thorough-bred hunter, of about sixteen hands
in height, with bone and muscle to match, capable, as
it would appear, of carrying a man-at-arms in full harness
through a long march or a pitched battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as he was on the point of starting, he observed
that one of his dogs, a favorite greyhound, was loose,
and about to follow him, when he commanded him to
be taken up instantly, rating the man who had held the
horses very harshly, and cursing him soundly for disobeying
his orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, when he saw that he was secure against the
animal’s following him, he turned his horse’s head to
the right hand, toward the great hills to the westward,
saying aloud, so that all the bystanders could hear him,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, lady fair, since we are only going for a
pleasure ride, suppose we go up toward the great deer-park
in the forest. By the way,” he added, turning in
his saddle to the old steward, who was standing on the
terrace, “I desired Haggerston, the horse-dealer, to
meet me here at noon, about a hunter he wants to sell
me. If I should not be back, give him some dinner,
and detain him till I return. I shall not be late, for I
fancy my lady will not care to ride very far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too sure of that, Jasper,” she replied,
with an arch smile, thinking to aid him in his project.
“It is so long since I have ridden out with you, that
I may wish to make a day of it. Come, let us start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she gave her jennet its head, and cantered
lightly away over the green, her husband following at
a trot of his powerful hunter; and in a few minutes
they were both hidden from the eyes of the servants,
among the clumps of forest-trees and the dense thickets
of the chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At something more than three miles’ distance from
Widecomb House, to the westward, there is a pass in
the hills, where a bridle-road crosses the channel of
the large brook, which I have named so often, and
which, at a point far lower down, was the scene of
Jasper’s ill-omened introduction to Theresa Allan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This bridle-road, leading from the sparse settlements
on Dartmoor to the nearest point of the seacoast, was
a rough, dangerous track, little frequented except by
the smugglers and poachers of that region, and lay for
the most part considerably below the level of the surrounding
country, between wooded hills, or walk of
dark gray rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The point at which it crosses the stream is singularly
wild and romantic, for the road and the river both are
walled by sheer precipices of gray, shattered, limestone
rock, nearly two hundred feet in height, perfectly
barren, bare, and treeless, except on the summits,
which are covered with heather and low, stunted
shrubbery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river itself, immediately above the ford, by
which the road passes it, descends by a flight of rocky
steps, or irregular shelvy rapids, above a hundred feet
within three times as many yards, and then spreads
out into a broad, open pool, where its waters, not ordinarily
above three feet deep, glance rapidly, but still
and unbroken, over a level pavement of smooth stone,
almost as slippery as ice. Scarce twenty yards below
this, there is an abrupt pitch of sixty feet in perpendicular
height, over which the river rushes at all times
in a loud foaming waterfall, but after storms among the
hills, in a tremendous roaring cataract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ford is never a safe one, owing to the insecure
foothold afforded by the slippery limestone, but when
the river is in flood, no one in his senses would dream
of crossing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it was by this road that Jasper had persuaded
his young wife that they could alone hope to escape
with any chance of safety, and to this point he was
leading her. And she, though she knew the pass,
and all its perils, resolute to accompany him through
life, and, if need should be, to death itself, rode
onward with him, cheerful and apparently fearless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached its brink, and the spectacle it afforded
was, indeed, fearful. The river swollen by the rains
of the past night, though, like all mountain torrents,
rising and falling rapidly, it was already subsiding,
came down from the moors with an arrowy rush, clear
and transparent as glass, yet deep in color as the rich
brown cairn-gorm. The shelvy rapids above the
ford were one sheet of snow-white foam, and in the
ford itself the foam-flakes wheeled round and round, as
in a huge boiling caldron, while below it the roar of
the cataract was louder than the loudest thunder, and
the spray rolling upward from the whirlpool beneath,
clung to the crags above in mist-wreaths so dense that
their summits were invisible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” cried Theresa, turning deadly pale, as
she looked on the fearful pool. “We are lost. It is
impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By heaven!” he answered, impetuously, “I must
pass it, or stay and be hanged. <span class='it'>You</span> can do as you
will, Theresa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is it possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly it is. Do you think I would lead you
into certain death? But see, I will ride across and return,
that you may see how easy it is, to a brave heart
and a cool hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, confident in the strength of his horse and in his
own splendid horsemanship, he plunged in dauntlessly,
and keeping up stream near to the foot of the upper
rapids, struggled through it, and returned to her without
much difficulty, though the water rose above the
belly of his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
He heard, however, that a fresh storm was rattling
and roaring, even now, among the hills above, and
he knew by that sign that a fresh torrent was even
now speeding its way down the chasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time to be lost—it was now or never.
He cast an eager glance around—a glance that read
and marked every thing—as he came to land; save
only Theresa, there was not a human being within
sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he said, with a smile, “there is no
danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” she answered, merrily. “Forgive me for
being such a little coward. But you will lead Rosabella,
wont you, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” he answered. “Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And catching the curb-rein of the pony with his
left hand, and guiding his own horse with his right,
holding his heavy loaded hunting-whip between his
teeth, he led her down into the foaming waters,
so that her palfrey was between himself and the
cataract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard work, and a fearful struggle for that
slender, light-limbed palfrey to stem that swollen river;
and the long skirt of Theresa’s dress, holding the
water, dragged the struggling animal down toward the
waterfall. Still, despite every disadvantage, it would
have battled to the other side, had fair play been
given it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when they reached the very deepest and most
turbulent part of the pool, under pretence of aiding it,
Jasper lifted the jennet’s fore-legs, by dint of the strong,
sharp curb, clear off the bottom. The swollen stream
came down with a heavier swirl, its hind legs were
swept from under it, in an instant, and with a piercing
scream of agony and terror, the palfrey was whirled
over the brink of the fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as it fell, unsuspicious of her husband’s horrible
intent, the wretched girl freed her foot from the stirrup,
and throwing herself over to the right hand, with a
wild cry, “Save me! save me, my God! save me,
Jasper!” caught hold of his velvet doublet with both
hands, and clung to him with the tenacious grasp of
the death-struggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even then—even then, had he relented, one touch
of the spur would have carried his noble horse clear
through the peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no! the instant her horse fell, he shifted his
reins to the left hand, and grasped his whip firmly in
the right; and now, with a face of more than fiendish
horror, pale, comprest, ghastly, yet grim and resolute
as death, he reared his hand on high, and poised the
deadly weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, even then, her soft blue eyes met his, full, in
that moment of unutterable terror, of hope and love,
even then overpowering agony. She met his eyes,
glaring with wolfish fury; she saw his lifted hand, and
even then would have saved his soul that guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no!” she cried, “oh no! I will let go—I will
drown, if you wish it; I will—I will, indeed! Oh God!
do not <span class='it'>you</span>—do not <span class='it'>you</span>—kill me, Jasper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as she spoke, she relaxed her hold, and
suffered herself to glide down into the torrent; but it
was all too late—the furious blow was dealt—with
that appalling sound, that soft, dead, crushing plash, it
smote her full between those lovely eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh God!—my God!—forgive—Jasper! Jasper!”—and
she plunged deep into the pool; but as the waters
swept her over the cataract’s verge, they raised her
corpse erect; and its dead face met his, with the eyes
glaring on his own yet wide open, and the dread, gory
spot between them, as he had seen it in his vision
years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood, motionless, reigning his charger in the
middle of the raging current, unmindful of his peril,
gazing, horror-stricken, on the spot where he had seen
her last—his brain reeled, he was sick at heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wild, piercing shout, almost too shrill to be human,
aroused him from his trance of terror. He looked upward
almost unconsciously, and it seemed to him that
the mist had been drawn up like a curtain, and that a
man in dark garb stood gazing on him from the summit
of the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If it were so, it was but for a second’s space. The fog
closed in thicker again than before, the torrent came
roaring down in fiercer, madder flood, and wheeling
his horse round, and spurring him furiously, it was all
that Jasper St. Aubyn could do, by dint of hand and
foot, and as iron a heart as ever man possessed, to
avoid <a id='foll'></a>following his victim to her watery grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once safe, he cast one last glance to the rocks, to
the river, but he saw, heard nothing. He whirled the
bloody whip over the falls, plunged his spurs, rowel-deep,
into the horse’s sides, and with hell <a id='inin'></a>in his
heart, he galloped, like one pursued by the furies of
the slain, back, alone, to Widecomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not yet high noon, when, wet from spur to
shoulder with mud and spray, bloody with spurring,
spotted from head to heel with gory foam-flakes from
his jaded horse’s wide-distended jaws, and quivering
nostrils, bareheaded, pale as death, and hoarse with
shouting, Jasper St. Aubyn galloped frantically up to
the terrace-steps of Widecomb House; and springing
to the ground, reeled, and would have fallen headlong
had he not been caught in the arms of one of the
serving men, who came running down the stone stairs
to assist him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he could collect breath to speak, “Call
all!” he cried, “call all! Ring the great bell, call all—get
ladders, ropes—run—ride—she is gone—she is
lost—swept over the black falls at Hawkshurt! Oh
God! oh God!” and he fell, as it seemed, senseless to
the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acting—sheer acting, all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They raised him and carried him up stairs, and laid
him on the bed—on <span class='it'>her</span> bed—the bed whereon he had
kissed her lips last night, and clasped her lovely form
which was now haply entwined in the loathsome coils
of the slimy mud-eels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shuddered. He could not endure it. He opened
his eyes again, and feigning to recover his senses, chid
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
the men from his presence, and again commanded, so
peremptorily, that none dare disobey him, that every
servant—man, woman, maid or boy—should begone to
the place he had named, nor return till they brought
back his lost angel’s body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They believed that he was mad; but mad or sane,
his anger was so terrible at all times, and now so fierce,
so frantic and appalling, that none dared to gainsay him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within half an hour after his return, save himself,
there was not a human being left within the walls of
Widecomb Manor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he arose and descended slowly, but with a firm
foot and unchanged brow, into the great library of the
Hall. It was a vast, gloomy, oblong chamber, nearly
a hundred feet in length, wainscoted and shelved with
old black-oak, and dimly lighted by a range of narrow
windows, with dark-stained glass and heavily wrought
stone mullions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a dull wood-fire smouldering under the
yawning arch of the chimney-piece, and in front of the
fire stood an old oaken table, and a huge leathern
arm-chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into this Jasper cast himself, with his back to the
door, which he had left open, in the absence of his
mind. For nearly an hour he sat there without moving
hand or foot, gazing gloomily at the fire. But, at
the end of that time, he started, and seemed to <a id='rere'></a>recollect
himself, opened the drawer of the writing-table,
and took out of it the record of his wretched
victim’s marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He read it carefully, over and over again, and then
crushed it in his hand, saying, “Well, all is safe now,
<span style='font-size:smaller'>THANK GOD</span>!” Yes, he <span class='it'>thanked God</span> for the success
of the murder he had done! “But here goes to
make assurance doubly sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with the word he was about to cast the paper
which he held into the ashes, when the hand of a man,
who had entered the room and walked up to him with
no very silent or stealthy step, while he was engrossed
too deeply by his own guilty thoughts to mark very
certainly any thing that might occur without, was laid
with a grip like that of an iron vice upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started and turned round; but as he did so, the
other hand of the stranger seized his right hand which
held the marriage record, grasping it right across the
knuckles, and crushed it together by an action so
powerful and irresistible, that the fingers involuntarily
opened, and the fatal document fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the man cast Jasper off with a violent jerk
which sent him to a distance of three or four yards,
stooped, gathered up the paper, thrust it into his bosom,
and then folding his arms across his stalwort breast,
stood quietly confronting the murderer, but with the
quietude of the expectant gladiator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper stared at the swarthy, sun-burned face, the
coal-black hair clipped short upon the brow, the flashing
eyes, that pierced him like a sword. He knew the
face—he almost shuddered at the knowledge—yet, for
his life, he could not call to mind where or when he
met him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he stared only for an instant; insulted—outraged—he,
in his own house! His ready sword was in his
hand forthwith—the stranger was armed likewise with
a long broadsword and a two-edged dagger, and heavy
pistols at his girdle; yet he moved not, nor made the
slightest movement to put himself on the defensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Draw, dog!” cried Jasper, furiously. “Draw and
defend yourself, or I will slay you where you stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold!” replied the other steadily. “There is
time enough—I will not baulk you. Look at me!—do
you not know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know you?—not I; by heaven! some rascal smuggler,
I trow—come to rob while the house is in confusion!
but you have reckoned without your host this
time. You leave not this room alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That as it may be,” said the other, coolly. “I
have looked death in the face too often to dread much
the meeting; but ere I die, I have some work to do.
So you do not know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a whit I, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then is the luck mine, for I know you right well,
young sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for whom do you know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a d—d villain always!” the man answered,
“two hours since, for Theresa Allan’s murderer! and
now, thanks to this paper, which, please God, I shall
keep, for Theresa Allan’s—husband!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke the last words in a voice of thunder, and
at the same time drew and cocked, at a single motion,
a pistol with each hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know too much—you know too much!” cried
Jasper, furious but undaunted. “One of us two must
die, ere either leaves this room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was for that end I came hither! Look at me
now, and know Durzil Bras-de-fer—Theresa Allan’s
cousin! your wife’s rejected lover once, and now—your
wife’s avenger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away! I will not fight you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, coward, with my own hands will I hang
you on the oak tree before your own door; and on
your breast I will pin this paper, and under it will
write, ‘<span class='sc'>Her Murderer</span>, taken in the fact, tried, condemned,
executed by me,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“ ‘<span class='sc'>Durzil Bras-de-fer</span>.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take up your pistols, then—they lie there on the
table. We will turn, back to back, and walk each to
his own end of the room, then turn and fire—if that
do not the work, let the sword finish it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen!” said St. Aubyn, “and the Lord have
mercy on your soul, for I will send it to your cousin in
five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And may the Fiend of Hell have yours—as he will,
if there be either Fiend or God. Are you ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then off with you, and when you reach the wall,
turn and fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he spoke, he turned away, and walked slowly
and deliberately with measured strides toward the door
by which he had entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he had taken six steps, however, a bullet
whistled past his ear, cutting a lock off his hair in its
passage, and rebounded from the wall, flattened at his
feet. Jasper had turned at once, and fired at him with
deliberate aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! double murderer! die in your treason!” and
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
the sailor leveled his pistol in turn, and pulled the
trigger; had it gone off, Jasper St. Aubyn’s days were
ended then and there; but no flash followed the sparks
from the flint—and he cast the useless weapon from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once they both raised their second pistol, and
again Jasper’s was discharged with a quick, sharp report;
and almost simultaneously with the crack, a dull
sound, as of a blow, followed it; and he knew that his
ball had taken effect on his enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Durzil’s pistol failed him; and then, for the
first time, Jasper observed that the seaman’s clothes
were soaked with water. He had swam that rapid
stream, and followed his beloved Theresa’s murderer,
almost with the speed of the stout horse that bore <span class='it'>him</span>
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a muscle of Durzil’s face moved, not a sinew
of his frame quivered, yet he was shot through the
body, mortally—and he knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swords!” he cried, “swords!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And bounding forward, he met the youth midway,
and at the first collision, sparks flew from the well-tempered
blades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no even conflict, no trial of skill—three deadly
passes of the sailor, as straight and almost as swift as
lightning, with a blade so strong, and a wrist so adamantine,
that no slight of Jasper’s could divert them,
were sent home in tierce—one in his throat, “That
for your lie!” shouted Durzil; a second in the sword
arm, “That for your coward blow!” a third, which
clove the very cavity of his heart asunder, “That for
your life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten seconds did not pass, from the first crossing of
their blades until Jasper lay dead upon the floor, flooding
his own hearth-stone with his life-blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Durzil leaned on his avenging blade, and looked
down upon the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is done! it is done just in time! But just! for I
am sped likewise. May the Great God have mercy
on me, and pardon me my sins, as I did this thing not in
hatred, but in justice and in honor! Ah—I am sick—sick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he dropped down into the arm-chair in which
Jasper was sitting as he entered; and though he could
hardly hold his head up for the deadly faintness, and
the reeling of his eyes and brain, by a great effort he
drew out the marriage record from his breast—Jasper’s
ball had pierced it, and it was dappled with his own
life-blood—and smoothed it out fairly, and spread it on
the board before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he fell back, and closed his eyes, and lay for a
long time motionless; but the slow, sick throbbing of
his heart showed that he was yet alive, though passing
rapidly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once he raised his dim eyes, and murmured, “They
tarry—they tarry very long. I fear me, they will
come too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But within ten minutes after he had spoken, the
sound of a multitude might be heard approaching, and
a quick, strong, decided step of one man coming on before
all the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the last few minutes, Durzil had seemed to
lose all consciousness and power. He was, indeed, all
but dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at these sounds he roused like a dying war-horse
to the trumpet; and as the quick step crossed
the threshold, he staggered to his feet, drew his hand
across his eyes, and cried, with his old sonorous voice,—it
was his last effort—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you found her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is here,” said the young seaman, pointing
with his hand to the corpse, which they were just
bearing into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he—ha! ha! ha! ha!—he is—there!” and he
pointed, with a triumphant wafture of his gory sword,
toward Jasper’s carcass, and then, with the blood
spouting from his mouth and nostrils, fell headlong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His officer raised him instantly, and as the flow of
blood ceased, he recovered his speech for a moment.
He pointed to the gaping crowd,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have—have you—told them—lieu—lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell—tell them—l-let me hear you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see that wound in her forehead—you saw it
all, from the first,” he said, to the crowd, who were
gazing in mute horror at the scene. “I told you, when
I took you to the body, that I saw her die, and would
tell you how she died, when the time should come.
The time has come. He—that man, whose body lies
there bleeding, and whose soul is now burning in
Tophet, murdered her in cold blood—beat her brains
out with his loaded hunting-whip. I—I, Hubert Manvers,
saw him do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a low, dull murmur in the crowd, not of
dissent or disbelief, but of doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who slew master?” exclaimed black Jem
Alderly, coming doggedly forward; “this has got to
be answered for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is answered for, Alderly,” said Durzil, in a faint
but audible voice. “I did it—I slew him, as he has
slain me. I am Durzil Olifaunt, whom men call Bras-de-fer.
Do any of you chance to know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, all on us! all on us!” shouted half the
room; for the frank, gallant, bold young seaman had
ever been a general favorite. “Huzza! for Master
Durzil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in spite of the horrors of the scene, in spite of
the presence of the dead, a loud cheer followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” he cried, “hush! this is no time for that,
and no place. I am a dying man. There is not five
minutes’ life in me. Listen to me. Did any of you
ever hear me tell a lie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should scarce, therefore, begin to do so now,
with heaven and hell close before my eyes. Hubert
Manvers spoke truly. I also saw him murder her—murder
his own wife—for such she was; therefore I
killed him!” He gasped for a moment, gathered his
breath again, and pointing to the table, “that paper,
Hubert—quick—that paper—read it—I—am going—quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man understood his superior’s meaning in
an instant, caught the paper from the table, beckoned
two or three of the older men about him, among others,
Geoffrey, the old steward, and read aloud the record
of the unhappy girl’s marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
At this moment the young vicar of Widecomb entered
the room, and his eyes falling on the paper, “That is
my father’s hand-writing,” he cried; “this is the missing
leaf of my church register!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she not—was she not—his—wife?” cried
Bras-de-fer, raising himself feebly on his elbow, and
gazing with his whole soul in his dying eyes at the
youthful vicar, and at the horror-stricken circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was—she was assuredly, his lawful wife, and
such I will uphold her,” said the young man, solemnly.
“Her fame shall suffer no wrong any longer—her soul,
I trust, is with her God already—for she was innocent,
and good, and humble, as she was lovely and loving.
Peace be with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor, poor lady!” cried several of the girls who
were present, heart-stricken, at the thought of their
own past conduct, and of her unvarying sweetness.
“Poor, poor lady!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hubert—Hubert—I—I have cleared her—char—her
character, I have avenged her death; lay me beside
her. In ten—ten minutes I shall be—God—bless—bless
you, Hubert—with Theresa! A—amen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was dead. He had died in his duty—which was
justice—truth—vengeance!</p>

<p class='pindent'>An artist was passing slowly through the thorough-fare
of a great city, where for a few days he was sojourning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a young man, and the few years of his life,
if they had proved heavy and sorrowful in experience,
had at least left no dark impress on his forehead. His
figure was strikingly elegant, and the face manly, and
very beautiful; it might well have been taken to represent
the Genius of Thought, so calm, elevated,
and ennobled by spiritual excellence was it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artist was a poor man; you could guess that by
the worn garments in which he was attired, for from
the figure, bearing, and whole appearance of the youth,
it was evident that he was not of that class of geniuses
who affect shabbiness in personal appearance, in the
name of eccentricity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was an ambitious young man, too. A glance
into his studio, where constantly and diligently he
toiled in his vocation, had told you that. It would
seem by the constant emendations he would make, and
by the finished style he labored to impart to all he did,
that nothing short of superior excellence or perfection
in his art, would satisfy him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has come into the open air this morning, not because
he is wearied with his work, for it is a source
of continual delight to him—neither in search of amusement,
but to ponder on a thought which has long harbored
in his mind—three pictures should be his fame.
From his quiet studio he would send into the world a
moral lesson that should delight and instruct, and leave
in the world an abiding moral influence. Not only did
Martin Gray long to win for himself a proud name on
the earth, but with the poets and the preachers he
would fain lift up his voice and teach—he also would
be a priest and a reformer, and by his works he would
testify to the infinite beauty of holiness and virtue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artist’s heart beat joyfully as he revolved this
idea in his mind—his hope was high—his hand was
skillful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If my name only ranks with the masters’ some
day—if I can do some real and substantial good in my
generation! I cannot labor too hard to secure these
ends,” he said to himself as he passed, unconscious of
the noise and confusion about him, along the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mechanically turning at the first corner, Martin
moved on to quarters of the city where the strife and
confusion of life were more subdued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once he stood silent, as though changed suddenly
to marble, then a heart-cheering cry of joy and surprise
burst from him, and “I have found it! I have found
it!” he cried—“here is sunrise at last!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were children playing in the street, poor
little children, boys and girls, whose only play-ground
was that hot and dusty place. But in the person of
one, the quick eye of the artist detected extraordinary
beauty, though decked in rags almost as extraordinary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unconscious child was a girl, six or seven years
of age, faultless in form and feature, the very embodiment
of one of Martin Gray’s ideals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not solely the exquisite loveliness of the
child’s face, though the shape and coloring were perfect—but
beside the dark rich hair, which fell in such
unheeded profusion on the shoulders of its little mistress—and
beside the deep, sapphire-blue of the large
languid eyes, and the classic regularity of every feature,
there was an expression, a <span class='it'>soul look</span>, which intensified
her natural beauty, and stamped her as the
owner of an intellect whose range was far higher than
that reached by any of her playmates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me your name, little angel,” said the artist, in
the excitement of his delighted surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Alice Flynn,” was the prompt answer,
accompanied by a smile and frank look of inquiry,
which read very plainly “what is <span class='it'>your</span> name—and
what do you want of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you a mother? Where does she live? Go
with me to your home—I must speak with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child answered these queries by at once leaving
her playmates—the artist followed her quickly, and in
a few moments they entered a narrow byway. Passing
a short distance through it, little Alice paused before a
shabby old frame house, which seemed every day on
the point of bidding an eternal farewell to all things
terrestrial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the place where we live, sir,” she said,
with the sweetest voice in the world; “will you come
in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little girl is yours, ma’am, I believe,” said
Martin, as he stood in the presence of what seemed to
him an ogress—a gigantic woman who certainly could
lay but little claim to beauty, when compared with the
“child-angel” who called her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—she wasn’t lost was she? Or was she up to
mischief in the street, just tell me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
“No, no—nothing of the kind,” said the artist
quickly—but not in the least daunted by the washer-woman’s
unamiable greeting—“I was struck with her
appearance—and now that I have at last an opportunity
of accomplishing an object I have long contemplated, I
trust you will not object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, sir, what is it ye want—speak it out quick
can’t ye—my work is waiting for me, don’t ye see?
Do you want the child’s front teeth, or her hair? I’ve
sold her hair twice to a barber, but her teeth—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mistake me,” exclaimed Martin Gray, sharply,
for he was disgusted with the cruel words of the
old beldam. “I am an artist—I would like to take her
likeness—will you permit me to do so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! what would you do with it? The girl’s
about spoiled now with people’s telling her how beautiful
she is. To be sure the child <span class='it'>is</span> well enough”—this
with a sort of brutish pride—“in looks, but beauty
don’t give us bread, and her good looks only spiles her—she’s
getting proud and hateful since people have
told her so much about it, the little fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is so, I fear it is not the wisest course to let
her play so much in the street with other little folks,”
said Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This approach to advice aroused the woman’s ire.
“Where’s she to be kept, I’d like to know that? A
poor woman like me as <span class='it'>arns</span> her bread by the sweat
of her face has little time to be looking about after the
young ones. People like me can’t keep their children
to home like other folks, who have plenty of room indoor
and out. So you see, young man, your advice
aint worth much any how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, madam, you know your own business
best; but, seriously, you cannot mean to refuse my
earnest request. I assure you it will be the greatest
favor to me if you will suffer me to take the child’s
picture. I am willing to pay you for the privilege.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it shall be done,” said the woman, brightening
up. “How much will you offer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two dollars,” answered the young man, “and I
will pay you more at some future day—but I also am
poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor fellow, he spoke the truth indeed, for the two
dollars were just half the contents of his old faded
purse at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she may go for that. Here Alice, you’re
gwine to have your face painted—let me brush you up
a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no, I pray madam, leave her to me. I will
take her to my studio as she is; I would not have her
appearance changed in the least—the drapery of the
child does not need any alteration, I will bring her to
you again in an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she’ll be safe enough, I ’spose, go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to paint my face, sir? What for?
Will it hurt me?” asked Alice Flynn as she, with
Martin, passed along the streets hand in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not your <span class='it'>face</span>, child,” answered the artist, “I’m
going to paint a face <span class='it'>like</span> yours—that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To hang up in my room, and then perhaps to sell
it some day for a great deal of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sell me! sell my face!” and the little innocent
laughed, and wondered why any body should want to
buy a face like hers!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, too busy with his own thoughts, made no
answer to her many exclamations of astonishment and
wonder. Two steps at a time, with the girl in his
arms, did the delighted youth ascend the three steep
and narrow flights of stairs which led to the poor little
attic room he dignified with the “name, style, and title”
of studio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A barren place it seemed to little Alice Flynn, for
such a nice gentleman to live in—indeed scarce a whit
better than her own poor home was it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you poor, too?” she asked, with childlike confidence—and
a most unchildish and unnatural sadness
was in her voice as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am poor—I paint pictures for a living, Alice.
I shall not grow rich in a day,” said the artist, and his
words were uttered with not quite the usual, light-hearted
happy tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably my reader will not soon, if ever, see the
original painting executed on that day which ever after
remained a date so memorable in the recollections of
Martin Gray. Let me, therefore, here state that the
Sunrise was a portrait quite dissimilar to those we
usually see of young children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now lie quietly, Alice, for a moment,” said Martin.
He had placed her on the ancient lounge, the
only reasonable piece of furniture in the room. “Now
close your eyes—ah! not <span class='it'>so</span> close, let them be half
open, as though you were just waking up—now I will
paint a picture the world shall wonder at! Yes, I also
will make a Sunrise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quietly and motionless, as though bereft of life, the
child lay and watched the artist’s movements; in him
she forgot herself, consequently had none of that intense
consciousness of expression so often perceivable in the
portraits of people who become immortalized, and perpetuated
on—canvas!</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a sight to see! the lonely desolate places where
the impoverished children of Genius, the painters,
sculptors, and poets, have with patient but almost hopeless
toil wrought out their wonder-works!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! eyes whose range of vision was circumscribed
by four contracted walls, have looked on scenes of
rarer and richer beauty than travelers in many climes
have seen; and voices, husky, tuneless with want and
grief, have breathed, even when tortured with the
death-agony, songs, that the world has hushed its
mighty voice, and its tumultuous heart to hear; warriors
have conquered on battle-fields, whose inspiration
was the song that burst from the dying son of poverty,
while pain and fever prostrated him, who kept back
by force of mind the advance of death, until the strain
of glory should be fully and perfectly conceived!</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour passed, and not for one moment had the
hand of the artist paused—it is enough to say that even he
was satisfied with the progress he had made in
those swift-winged sixty minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the easy couch Alice had fallen asleep, unperceived
by the young painter—he awakened her with
some regret, but the time he had promised to keep her
with him was passed, and Martin had little inclination
to brave the wrath of the mother’s tongue. Thoughtfully
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
he led the child to her home, and when he parted
with her there, it was with a heart full of sorrow, for
he knew that a life of hardship, and want, and temptation,
was in store for the beautiful girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor and handsome,” thought he—“God protect
her! To be sure it would be a sad sight were the innumerable
host of poor people all hideously ugly—and
as to the <span class='it'>necessity</span> of the thing, such folks would seem
to require the simple pleasure of being admired, inasmuch
as they are debarred from participating in all
amusements and enjoyments that cost money, and
beauty costs nothing. And yet Heaven have mercy on
the poor family that boasts of a beauty! as surely as
the sunshine, pride will creep in under the door-sill or
by the window, and certainly in a covert manner. The
pretty daughter must be prettily dressed, even at the
expense, and by the self-denial of the more plainly
gifted remainder of the family. Then come struggles,
heart-bitterness and envy—God be thanked if hatred
and malice do not also come! Now there’s that little
Alice Flynn—if she were only my sister, or one over
whom I had the shadow of control! Oh! that I were
only rich! She ought to be educated! Heavens!
what a smile—and what a mind she has—she thinks!
God defend her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indulging in such thoughts as these Martin had passed
again through the crowded streets, quite unmindful
of all things save that one high project he had
conceived, which now, he for the first time felt convinced
might be really performed. Once more we find
him before his easel, and how he labored there! Six
days, morning and evening, he worked on his creation,
and Saturday night saw him looking upon it with such
intensity of satisfaction, as betokened a very happy
heart—for it was finished, and his heart and his mind
had declared it “very good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following week there was to be an exhibition
of the paintings of native artists in New York, and to
the rooms prepared for this purpose Martin conveyed
his work, and it was not perhaps without a thrill of
pride that he placed it among the multitudinous proofs
of genius there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sunrise was unframed, and having been among
the last brought in, it occupied an obscure and unfavorable
position. But Martin surveyed it with the eyes
of a lover—he knew its superior merit, and he fancied
that others would behold it in just such a light. But
Martin was destined to be disappointed not a little;
during the first days of the exhibition, while the rooms
were filled to overflowing, but little attention was attracted
toward his portrait. Sometimes it was so fortunate
as to attract an exclamation of surprise, and a
momentary glance of admiration—and once or twice
a group of young people stopped a moment to honor it
with examination, but there were works of well known
artists which must be criticised and applauded—there
were “first attempts” of rich and fashionable men
which must be praised—and besides, it was on the
whole taken for granted by universal consent, that the
best pictures occupied the most prominent stations, and
that those condemned to the back-ground must necessarily
be only passably good or mediocre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By degrees Martin began to take these facts into
consideration—and then it was only by great effort he
managed to keep his hopes alive, that some good fate
was yet in store for his darling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An early hour on the morning of the fifth day found
him once more attracted to the rooms, he would endeavor
to secure for his child a position more prominent,
for some of the paintings had been already
removed by their masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But two persons were there when he entered. They
were a lady and gentleman in deep mourning, and they
were standing before <span class='it'>his</span> Sunrise! Passing up the long
hall slowly, with his eyes directed to the thickly covered
wall, where he saw what only an artist could,
the outwritten, burning hopes of a multitude of men, he
contrived to keep watch of the two who remained
so long motionless and speechless before the pictured
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the author of this work, sir; and if
it is for sale?” asked the stranger as Martin drew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have an acquaintance with the artist,” answered
he, “but the painting, I think, is not for sale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should it be placed here then?” asked the
gentleman quickly, and with great evident disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, sir, there is something dear to the heart
of the author of a work, beside the money which the
sale of it would bring. I feel at liberty to answer you
frankly as you have asked—the artist hoped that by
this work attention might be attracted to his skill, for
he is a young man necessitated to labor, and, as yet,
altogether unknown in his profession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I admire the genius of the young man, he will succeed
in making himself known beyond all doubt. But
perhaps I might offer for this picture a sum great
enough to satisfy even him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a silence, and there was in the lady’s
eyes such a beseeching look as she glanced from the
picture toward Martin, that his determination was almost
vanquished, but he looked down and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The painting is my work—I cannot part with it at
any price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is yours! and you will not sell it! Mr. Artist,
you do not, cannot know how much you refuse us!
We had a child, a darling little girl, she was an angel
to us—she is lost to us, is dead, young man!—and this
portrait! it is so like her, at any cost I would secure
it. Name your price, high as you value your beautiful
work, consider that to us it is infinitely more valuable!
the hours of labor you have spent upon it have endeared
it to you—it is more to us though than even that, it
is life to us, for it brings <span class='it'>her</span> back again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady trembled as her companion pleaded with
the artist so earnestly. It was not in Martin Gray to
deny a plea so sad and so heartfelt. “It shall be
yours,” he exclaimed, “permit me to retain the work
but a few days, and it shall then be returned to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thankful glance of the tearful eyes of the bereaved
mother was what Martin thought at that moment a full
reward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, sir! you have made us happy!
If five thousand dollars is any compensation, they are
yours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was another kind of reward! The young artist
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>
thought both invaluable; and it was with a light
heart that with the picture in its case, he carried it
once more to the attic studio.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Gray’s fortune was made, and ever after was
he a firm believer in presentiments, for the Sunrise had
in very truth been the making of him. In the midst of
his good fortune, the generous heart did not forget the
poor child whose beauty had so materially aided his
genius. Previous to his departure for the old world,
he placed a well-filled purse in the hands of the mother,
saying, “Your child is an extraordinary girl.
This money will be sufficient to secure her a good
education—pray do not neglect it, for she will be an
honor and a great help to you some day. Promise me
that you will keep her out of the street as much as is
possible, and that you will send her to school. I am
going abroad, when I come home again she will be
many years older than now, nearly a woman. Give
me your promise she shall be sent to school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she shall go, and as to keeping her out of the
street, I s’pose I might as well undertake to—Well,
yes, I’ll try my hand at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be kind to her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin traveled abroad; he studied in Italy—he
studied in Germany—he journeyed through nearly all
Europe. Among artists, and artist-patronizers, the
success of his first exhibited picture was well-known,
the Sunrise was every where commented
upon, and the papers liked to talk of the young
artist Martin Gray, of his skillful hand, and generous
heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But during the years of labor and study spent abroad,
his one great idea remained unaccomplished. The
second picture which he had designed as a continuation
of the Sunrise, was untouched. The imagination
was not to be suffered to do the work in this instance
either—but the second work, even as the first had been,
should be a portrait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still his hands had not been idle. In Paris his studio
(it was not there an attic!) became a point of interest
and fashionable attraction, and in Hamburg the American
artist dwelt neither in poverty nor obscurity. The
walls of his rooms were adorned with evidences of his
capabilities, and beside the honors heaped upon him,
in a pecuniary point of view, his labors had made his
fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years passed on, and Martin was at home again; at
home and among a multitude of friends, though when
seven years ago he sailed from the great city he might
easily have counted the voices that came to bid adieu
and God-speed. But fame and fortune wonderfully
enhance the feeble interest felt in the once poor son
of Genius—so Martin Gray proved it. His friendship
was sought for as most honorable, his words were
quoted, his dress and style imitated—fair ladies trilled
his songs, (for he was something of a poet, too,) and as
a “lion” the young exquisite was pronounced by fathers,
mothers, and daughters, as perfect, charming,
and altogether unexceptionable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what in the way of amusements, Frank?”
asked the artist, as arm-in-arm with a city gallant, he
strolled along Broadway a few days after his arrival in
New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! not heard yet that <span class='it'>Alice</span> gives a musical
entertainment to-night? My good fellow you ‘argue
yourself unknown’ by such unseemly ignorance,”
gayly said his companion, the Hon. Francis Dundas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I must confess to ignorance; who is this
great singer, Alice—some newly risen star, is she
not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—but the few who have heard, say a star that
bids fair to prove on closer examination of the first
magnitude, and that even an artist’s eyes can detect no
defect in her matchless beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And which point of the compass does she hail
from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! she is a native of our city. Her rare beauty
some time since attracted the attention of old H——,
the millionaire—he does something toward educating
her; she turns out a woman, or girl of uncommon talents,
and has determined to become a public singer.
I am told her history is a complete romance, wanting
nothing of tragedy or comedy to make it irresistibly
interesting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A singer—a genius—and a beauty! we will hear
her by all means!” exclaimed Martin enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they did hear her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a “grand entertainment.” The singer
Alice was the sole performer. She had preferred that
it should be so, that her merits and powers, whatever
they were, might be estimated at their worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Small and select was the audience before which she
appeared; it was composed of people of refined taste,
who could fully appreciate all the excellencies of style
and manner, and whose approbation a young debutante
might rejoice to win. How young she was! how truly
and perfectly beautiful! There was a slight flush on
her cheek which was else pale as marble, that told
how strongly the chords of her brave heart were
struck. She sang—oh! the voice whose tones filled
the high hall was like that we hear in dreams, when
angels come to keep watch over us, chanting through
the long hours of the night! During the whole first
part of the concert there was intense silence, for there
was an intense gratification felt by the audience that
was deeper than could be uttered, and the smiles, and
tears, and breathless interest evinced, were to the
maiden tributes more acceptable than tumultuous applause
had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a wonder!” “a miracle!” “what a voice!”
“what a style!” “and then to think she is only seventeen
or eighteen!” Such and like exclamations escaped
from every heart as “Alice” withdrew at the
close of the first part from the saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank Dundas turned to his companion—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Gray, what do <span class='it'>you</span> think of her? Your wits
seem wandering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am lost! it is divine! I have never seen or heard
her equal. Tell me, what did you say is her name;
the face haunts me; I could swear I have seen it
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut! swear not at all. It’s not likely you have
ever seen her before to-night. Perhaps she corresponds
with some fairy-queen or lady-love born of your own
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
prolific fancy. Is it not so? I can well conceive
such a thing possible, though I’m neither poet nor
artist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin bowed to save himself from the necessity of
a reply, for he was deep in thought, and through the
obscurity of the distant Past his memory was striving
to grope her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few moments the singer appeared again in
the saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you say her name is Alice?” asked Martin
Gray, as his eyes for the second time rested upon her.
“Alice—Alice what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never heard—she is only known by that
name. She does not need so many cognomens as we
less gifted individuals, and I suppose intends that the
world shall know without being told further, who is
meant when the singer <span class='it'>Alice</span> is spoken of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dundas, I have seen that face before, you may depend
upon it—will you believe it? during all my residence
in Europe I have sought with desperate earnestness,
but in vain, for a face just such as hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray wherefore? Are you not the sworn foe of
all lady-loves save the sweet goddess of painting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! love has had nothing to do with my search—pretty
faces are to be found every where; and though
an artist, I am free to say the man who marries a woman
for her beauty is a poor fool. Did you ever see
my picture called Sunrise, painted seven or eight years
ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember it? Why, my dear fellow, to be sure
I do, and what a grand lift it gave you before the
‘darling public;’ I would be stupid indeed to forget
that picture or its author. A copy of it has been the
best ornament of my room for years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps you know—though of course you
could not, for I never spoke of my intention to another—but
ever since that picture was finished, I have determined
to make it one of a series, by painting two
others, one of such innocent loveliness arrived at womanly
perfection, and the third was to be the image of
crime, or beauty ruined; and the three I hoped to
offer a moral lesson to the world. Never till to-night
have I seen one worthy to take the second place in the
series. I see her now, and I have an impression that
amounts almost to a conviction, that this woman is
that child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She lives on Tenth street. If it is your wish we
will visit her to-night when the concert is finished, or
to-morrow—perhaps, however, you would prefer calling
upon her alone?” said Frank Dundas with a hearty
co-operating look of voice and manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all means accompany me—we will go in the
morning, and I will lay my life on it, that singer’s
name, when a child, was Alice Flynn!”</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'>At eleven the following morning the lady was alone
in her simply furnished apartment, in a boarding-house
on Tenth street. The beauty which had dazzled
all who beheld her on the previous night, did not owe
any thing to dress or to lamp-light, it bore the inquisitive
glance of the sunshine well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice received her guests, the Hon. Frank Dundas,
and the artist Martin Gray, with a grace and ease of
manner which delighted them. She spoke with the
enthusiasm of youth of the art in which she was so
great a proficient, and every word she uttered revealed
a mind well cultivated, refined, and innately noble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A half hour passed speedily by, but the Honorable
gave no sign of an intention to depart. The artist, who
had surveyed her as he would an exquisite production
of art, first rising to take his leave, said—“I have a
favor to urge, madam, it is a very great one; I am
painting a series of portraits, will you permit me to
take yours as a representation of Noonday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a very poor representative of the glory
and majesty of the theme you have chosen. Pardon
me, I must decline an honor so unmerited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Permit <span class='it'>me</span> to judge that,” said Martin Gray earnestly.
“It is an idea I have long desired to carry out;
I wished to make the picture an exact likeness, and
therefore sought a beauty that was perfect, so there
should be no work left for my imagination—now that
the object of my long search is found, do not deny me
this great privilege. If you will only accompany some
of your friends to my studio, by showing to you the
Sunrise, I can better explain what it is I wish; or perhaps
you will suffer me either now or to-morrow to
escort you thither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow,” she answered, “I will come. Ere
then you may, I trust, find one elsewhere to represent
your ideal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is utterly impossible. To-morrow, then, before
the rooms are filled with visiters, I shall look for
you,” said Martin, with a decidedly grateful accent
and look, and the young men walked slowly away.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Noonday was nearly finished. The city was
ringing with the surpassing beauty and the matchless
voice of the young singer Alice. And Martin Gray’s
numerous and powerful friends every where declared
that the picture on which he worked so diligently,
would add the greenest leaf to his glory-wreath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artist loved his picture—loved he the original?
No! he could have worshiped the canvas on which
that matchless face was impressed, but when he looked
on Alice, and listened to her beautiful words and the
so musical, delicious pronunciation, though he saw and
heard with the most enthusiastic admiration, it was
still only that of the artist—the <span class='it'>man’s</span> heart was untouched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never shown to her the “child-angel.” After
his call upon “Alice,” so strengthened was become
Martin Gray’s persuasion that it was <span class='it'>the</span> Alice of bygone
recollections, that he feared to hazard the display
of the portrait to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us see if his precaution was a wise one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the last sitting. On the following day the
lady was to depart with a distinguished company of
singers, on a long professional tour through the Western
and Southern cities. She had risen, for the hour
was passed, and stood looking for the last time on the
beautiful works of the artist, which adorned the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember,” said Martin, approaching her,
“I promised to show you the portrait which I called
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
the Sunrise, pardon me that I have not done so before,
this is the one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his hand and turned to the light a small
picture, which for the few past days had looked upon
the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A broken exclamation of surprise, rather than the
usual tribute of warm praise, escaped the young
creature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did <span class='it'>you</span> paint this?” she asked. “Pray tell me
when and how?” she added, recovering her self-possession
immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a youth, very poor and needy, having some
talent, and a great deal of taste for sketching and painting.
Very unfortunately, as I thought, I was forced
either to altogether resign this employment so delightful
to me, or to pursue it in order to supply myself with
food and clothes. To me it must not be a pastime—I
could not hesitate long—it became my profession.
But I had, what to you may seem an inconceivable
dislike to painting faces merely as a workman paints
letters on a sign. I imagined that it was just as easy
to win the smiles of dame Fortune by picturing only
the exceedingly beautiful, and giving them emblematic
names, and I was not altogether wrong. Passing one
day through the streets of this very city, I came upon
a group of children playing—one of that little band
struck me as being nothing short of perfection, I could
think of nothing as I looked on her, but how beautiful
a sunrise!—how splendid will be the day that ensues!
At my request the child guided me to her home, it
was a poor one, and therein bore a great resemblance
to my own. The mother consented that I should take
the child’s likeness, and—this is it, I never saw the
little one again. Afterward, as I have told you, for
many years I traveled in Europe, but though constantly
on the look out, I never found a Noonday worthy to
follow a Sunrise like this child’s. I thank you, madam,
that I have in you, and in my own city, at last found
what Europe could not show me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask,” said the lady, with face slightly averted
from the gaze of Martin Gray, “may I ask the
name of the girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the question which of all others the artist
most wished her to propose, and he watched her
closely, as in a careless tone that belied his glance, he
said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember it very well—it was Alice Flynn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you—it is indeed a lovely picture! You
have amply deserved, sir, all the honors that are, or
can be awarded to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Gray attended her to the carriage that stood
in waiting, but Alice the songstress did not look upon
him till she gave him her hand in parting, when he saw
her face, then, the artist knew he had not been deceived;
she was pale as death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few months afterward, came from a city far to the
South, a letter to our <span class='it'>hero</span>, its contents were a five
hundred dollar note, and these words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The child for whose education you so generously
provided when both she and yourself were poor and
unknown, would fain convince you that with increase
of years, and fortune, and happiness, she has not forgotten—that
she is not ungrateful. All the good that
has fallen to her in this life she is glad and proud to
trace directly to you, to that one act of well-timed
charity. May the God of Heaven for ever bless you.
The ‘Sunrise’ and the ‘Noonday’ of your life you have
made unspeakably glorious, may the night be without
a cloud, and complete in its magnificence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It required no shrewd <span class='it'>guesser</span> to determine for Martin
Gray the author of this brief note. The cities of
the South were at that very moment vieing with each
other in lauding the Northern songsters, and the queen
of beauty and of song, the lady “Alice”—and the artist
rejoiced in her brilliant success, and waited with
impatience till he should see and speak with her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the years when honors thickly clustered around
his brow, when Fortune had laid many of her choicest
gifts at his feet, there was yet one thing wanting to
complete his happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were few homes on earth so beautiful as his,
and his wife and children (for Martin in course of time
became an old man,) were all that the heart of man
could desire. There were no lines betokening care,
or a fierce strife with the world, on the artist’s handsome
face. He had labored, and that constantly, it is
true, but his had not been a wearying toil, rather such
as had been intensely satisfying. The visions of beauty
with which he mentally surrounded himself; had never
been frightened away by rough and harsh experience—to
him even as in his youth, “all things beautiful
were what they seemed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many enchanting, perfect works had gone forth
from the rooms of Martin Gray into the world, but
there were two original ones for which he rejected
every offer, however extravagant. Copies and engravings
of them had been given to the public, but the
canvas on which his fingers worked while his eyes
were gazing on the loveliest and most perfect specimens
of beauty to his mind conceivable, were precious
beyond all price to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The series had not been completed, for Martin Gray
had never seen a human being fearfully beautiful, and
irrevocably fallen, whereby to represent the “Night.”
And as years passed on, his heart more earnestly and
continually hoped that he never might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great artist is dead. The passing visions of a
beautiful fancy have forever flitted away—“he sleeps
the last sleep”—but his works live after him. They
live to speak to us of their creator—to tell us of his
goodness, of the deep unfathomed spring of human love
within his heart. He sleeps, but he has left a name
that is cherished by his country, and his genius is a
source of national pride. How well is he remembered
and loved by those who knew him! And the students
in his own glorious art, with what enthusiasm and reverence
do they cherish a memory of him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>During his widow’s life his studio remained as he
had left it—it was a Mecca to which for years pilgrims
most devout resorted. To many that artist’s rooms
were sacred places; standing in them they breathed the
air of inspiration, and held sweet communings with the
spirit of the Beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the sublime lessons, and they were many, which
spoke forth from those walls, there was one that made
the gazer shudder and turn pale. No one gazing on
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
the three faces which were separated from all other
paintings wrought by the same hand, could have resisted
the conviction that the artist had meant, ay, and
that he had succeeded in conveying to the mind of the
gazer, a deep and awful moral lesson, for the “Night”
was with the “Sunrise” and the “Noonday!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was marvellous, it was dreadful to trace the great
resemblance between the likeness of the angelic little
child, the incomparably beautiful maiden, and the
splendid, but fallen woman!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same bright curling hair, the same deep, sapphire
eyes, the fresh bloom on the fair cheek, the
graceful form—they were unmistakeable. But oh!
there was an expression on those features of the eldest
woman, that the innocent child and the guileless maiden
could not have interpreted—it was a bold, defiant look,
that told it was a sorrowful and an ever-to-be-lamented
day that saw her come before the world to wrestle for
its honors—a very siren, but ah! how weak to strive
against its sinful allurements, its awful temptations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are one and the same, said every heart that
gazed upon them. Reader, <span class='it'>they were</span>! For the
“Night” was also a <span class='it'>portrait</span>, and the last work of
Martin Gray!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! alas! sweet Alice! splendid and courted
Alice! wretched and ruined Alice!</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Thou canst not comfort me. I’d rather hear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The serpent’s hiss than speech from a false heart.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There was a time thy voice had power to calm,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And lay the fiend within me: Let me rest</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lonely and cursed amid my wretchedness;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I have ventured all and lost—’twas Destiny!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There are dark spirits moving through the world,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Casting a saddening influence over all</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Within their vortex: Such perchance is mine;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With its wild, fitful struggles, and its gleams</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Now good, now evil, stronger with my strength</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The eclipse of Heaven’s brightness. Who can read</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The unknown language of the human heart,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Though writ in fiery characters? Where the power</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To judge an erring creature, when the thoughts,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Hidden even to himself, cannot be fathomed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Save by Omniscience? In thy hollow hand</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Measure the waters of the depthless sea,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or with far-seeing vision through the expanse</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of yonder firmament of Heaven, speak</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of that which is to be, though yet unseen</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In its bright pages: Easier task for man</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Than judge his brother justly. To myself</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I am a mystery, why not to thee?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The waters of my heart are deeper far</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Than plummet ever sounded. Oh, dark Future!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thy veil once lifted, will the power be given</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To note their secret depths. Why have I trusted</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But to be deceived? and not by man alone!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Why have I ever loved, if but to love</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Has been to bind myself upon the wheel</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of wretchedness? The punishment of gods!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Why should I ask for sunshine on my heart,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>If with it, it must wither? ask thyself.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Reading thine own heart’s secret, thou may’st learn</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How much I needed sympathy. My path,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Now filled with rankest weeds, might have been pure</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Under thy smile and teaching. Now, too late!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To wrestle with the world for an existence,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Bowed, but not crushed by Fate, is of itself</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Enough to turn the heart to bitter gall,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And make it curse, where, in its sunnier hours,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>It might have shed a blessing. Fortune’s smile,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Unto the favored, clothes the earth with flowers;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Its frown, alas! will make the brightest spot</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Black as a demon’s glance—its fruit as bitter</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As the Dead Sea’s—and like it naught but ashes!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The meanest thing,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Infuriated in the hunter’s toils,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Turns at the last with fierce and vengeful cry</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To battle with its foe; and some there are,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lost to all hope, in their own quiv’ring flesh</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Implant their poisonous venom, choosing thus</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To be themselves their executioners,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Than fall upon the spear of might and wrong.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Such do I fear myself: That I have been,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In happier days, a lover of my kind⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Heart as capacious, hand as firm and true,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As ever graced the proudest in the land.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I have been thus—<span class='sc'>Answer!</span> what am I now?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I have found coldness where I looked for love⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ingrates ’mid friends—the half averted head,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With the neglectful glance, that seemed to say,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thou art not of us now! Half-way to meet</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And pay back scorn by scorn, keener than that</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The eye of man e’er threw upon me—thus</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Was I ever—thus will ever be:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Though it heap coals of fire upon my head,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And writhe me with its tortures, still my soul,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Strong in its desperate fury, asks no boon</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But hate, to be repaid by darker hate⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Failing in that, to die unwept, unsung.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Madness is not my portion—I shall live!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And from the chaplet round the brow of Fame</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Yet seize, perchance, a leaf. Love in my heart</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Is not yet all extinct: what it has been,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Brighter and purer than the present hour,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Has fled forever! Yet I cannot live</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Unloving and unloved. But hand in hand</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With my ambition, upward must it rise,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Subordinate, yet true unto the truthful.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Into the channels where deceit has crept⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Into the hearts unfaithful—o’er the paths</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of those who have repaid my love with guile,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The blast of my sirocco hate shall sweep,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sudden to rise and swift to overthrow.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Such are my thoughts.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Would they were written on my brow, that all</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Might read the tale untold. My story’s brief.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>’Tis the twin passions—they have mastery,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And sway my pulse of life.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;There are brief moments</p>
<p class='dramaline'><span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span></p>
<p class='dramaline'>When passion lieth sleeping, and my mind</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Reveling in its dominion, far removed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From petty cares and struggles, soars aloft</p>
<p class='dramaline'>(Smiling amid its tortures, then forgotten,)</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Through the dark Future; with untiring wing,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Restless as the young eaglet, seeks the sun</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of light, and truth, and wisdom: or retiring</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Back to the brilliant, unforgotten past,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where every foot of earth contains a portion</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of immortality, seeks out its mate,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That may have wrestled with the storms of Time</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And won the victor’s crown: or, from the page</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of mighty spirits, who have left a deep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And never-failing well of giant thought,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Feeding my flickering lamp of life, nor dream</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There is a world elsewhere, but in the visions</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The arch-enchanters have raised up for Time!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>God’s blessings on ye, noble-hearted men!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How often to this saddened soul of mine</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Have ye brought strength and hope! Earth has not</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Jewels so rare, as those ye thickly scatter</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upon the wind for your posterity.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To me your voices,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In the still midnight, in the garish day,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Have ever gently come: I trust in you⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And ye are faithful: Rest forever with me.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The prophet lore of Israel—the sound</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of swelling harps by Grecian wizards strung⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Promethean echoes!—the ever-burning page</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of England’s brighter days—the undying song</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of richest Shakspeare—and the noble strains</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of master-minds drinking their inspiration</p>
<p class='dramaline'>From his pure fountain—all the mighty line⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sweeps by this distant shallow generation,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The monody of Time!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Sweet friends!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My heart henceforth must nestle in your loves,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or be forever lost. When forgotten,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For a brief period, ’mid the worldly strife</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And emptiness of things, how sinks my spirit,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Imprisoned ’mid the iron bars of forms.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I have no hope of happiness in life,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That is not bound up with the mighty past.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The present is a Hell—the future, dark.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Earth’s comforters are for the happy few.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>No denizen am I. I stand alone.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Alone, for judgment?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stormy and wild my passions—full of sins,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Grievous and bitter. Who shall succor me?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I looked to love—I found it hollowness.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I looked to hate—I found it bitterness.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Unto ambition—and it smiled upon me</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But to elude my grasp:—unto a future,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My stubborn heart refuses its belief.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I have not learned deceit, nor schooled myself</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To be a hypocrite. What I am, I am!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The secret sin of man—Hypocrisy⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Can never mate with me: Would that it could.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Wer’t so, I would not suffer as I must.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Could I but veil myself thus from men’s eyes,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And seem the thing I am not, I might live</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Happier in this world’s love. But let that pass.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I will not bend my knee, or lose one spark</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of Heaven’s heritage—my manhood’s truth⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But trample on the vampires of the world,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who fatten on the blood of noble things.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>What though the strife’s unequal? Let me fall,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Strong in my ruined hopes; the shrine profaned</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Within the inner temple, is to me</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Dearer than all now opened to my soul;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So let me die with prayer upon my lips,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And like old Israel’s stricken one, pull down</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A glorious desolation in my fall!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Wild are my thoughts, oh God!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And wilder still the passionate heart that beats</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With a fallen angel’s power. There liveth not</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Among earth’s myriads, a more restless spirit,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So formed for good or ill!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I have been gentle,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Loving and kind to all. My curse has been</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To feel the unkind thought—to doubt all truth⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of woman and of man. Naught’s left me now</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But shaken confidence and cheated hopes,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A long and drear account to be repaid</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With interest manifold. The restless fire</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That has preyed upon my brain, and blasted life⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Destroyed my peace, and made me stern and strong</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As the avenging fury, must recoil</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upon the heads of those whose path has been</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In triumph o’er my heart.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Shall I then spare?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who spared me where I trusted most? Whose hand</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Clasped firmly mine? Speak! whose kind word,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When sorrow was upon me, came unto me,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As it should come, in peace, and bid me hope?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The butterflies that thronged around my steps,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But to fly from me when the sun went down?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I think of them, not to give blow for blow,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But to tramp out their false hearts ’neath my heel.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>They left a sting behind—but yet I live!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ay! they shall feel I live.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Their loss was naught.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The serpent’s tooth was nearer to my heart</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That tortured me to madness. I had loved;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thou knowest it. Call it love—idolatry!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For it was my religion. All but that⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Power, wealth and friends—I could have lost,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Hadst thou but trustfully still kept thy vow,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Calming the raging fever of my brain!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Well! when these painted lizards crawled aside,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And I clung, like the wretched mariner,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Unto a straw, I deemed a plank, for life.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Whose voice came o’er the deep and angry sea,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Bidding me be of faith and hope? Speak, now!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>What! art thou voiceless? Nearer, bend thine ear!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Nay, shudder not—there’s “method in my madness!”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I would not shriek it out aloud, for fear</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The sound might create revelry in Hell!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Not the one I loved.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Not hers, whose every thought was mine—not hers,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who should have searched my deep, unquiet heart,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And soothed it in its agony. Oh no!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Too hard a task to ask this boon of her,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Whose dearest thought seemed but to learn the way</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To help to crush—not save.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Oh God! forgive me!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>How much of sorrow, sin and shame, my life</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Would have been guiltless of, had but the one⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The only one of earth—reached forth her hand,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And with that hand, her heart, to lift me up</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And keep my manhood pure.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It was a dream!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I only deemed it but her duty here;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I may have asked too much! ’Tis over now.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The sharpest strife is o’er, and I must be</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Sufficient to myself. The past can ne’er</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Recall itself to me, but with my tears,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That have been tears of blood. Would that the fate</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of the Olympus-stricken Niobe</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Had been mine also—that I had been marble.</p>
<p class='dramaline'><span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span></p>
<p class='dramaline'>Oh charity! oh love! how much we need</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Thy softening power. Ye, whose hearts are bowed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Before a great Creator; ye, whose thoughts</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Should be all purity—cannot ye feel</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The power given you to soothe and calm</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The troubled souls of weary-hearted men,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who wrestle, like the Titan, ’gainst the power</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of the Omnipotent! Hurling ever back</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Against the thunderer’s bolts, an avalanche,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Cleft from the cloud-topped hills of human pride,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The settlings of a world of hate and scorn.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>And with it, all the poetry of youth,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The summer of existence—lost forever.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As fleeting as the bubble, Reputation⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As false as social ties—delusive all⁠—</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We should be seriously grieved if the expression
<span class='it'>sage</span> of which we made use at the end of the preceding
chapter should lead the too credulous reader into a
dangerous error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tendency of this edifying history is to prove, on
the contrary, in the most simple and incontrovertible
manner, that however man may subdue his passions
and limit his enjoyments to the rigorous circle traced
by fortune, it is sufficient that these passions exist, and
that he is their slave, to disturb the most philosophical
mind, and to excite tempests that are the more violent
because concentrated in a narrow space. Of what
import are the dimensions of the scene? A perturbation
in a glass of water is a tempest full of horror to
the fly who ventures to brave its dangers. Well, the
worthy Major Anspach was this imprudent insect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One fine day in April, when the air was soft and
balmy, the descendant by the female line of the last
Dukes of Lorraine, having brushed with the greatest
care his long brown overcoat and his black plush pantaloons,
sought, at his usual stately pace, his favorite
resting-place, and its perfumes. The frequenters of
“Provence in Miniature,” as that end of the garden
is called. Children, nurses, young men and girls,
were so well acquainted with the “man of the bench,”
that no one was permitted to usurp the seat which so
long possession had consecrated to his use; what,
then, was the painful surprise of the major on approaching
his domain to find it occupied!</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first impulse was to take the affair in the simplest
form of view, to go up and explain to the audacious
invader of his privileges by what a continuous
occupation he, Major Anspach, Baron of Phalsbourg,
descended in the female line from the last Dukes of
Lorraine, had acquired the exclusive right to sit in
that angle of the wall, between the jasmine and the
flowering roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the necessity he would be under of divulging
his birth was repugnant to his pride; and as the individual
occupying the bench—<span class='it'>his</span> bench—was an old
man like himself; long like himself, thin and unhappy
like himself, and who appeared, like himself, not to
enjoy many of the luxuries of life, and whose face,
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
like his own, bore traces of long suffering, and painful
struggles with adversity; our worthy major contented
himself by throwing upon the unknown the glance of
an old lion—who on returning to his den and finding it
occupied by another old lion dying, passes on—so our
major. “It assuredly is only a temporary occupant,”
said he mentally—“a walk to the end of the avenue
and he will have departed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he deceived himself—he wandered from walk
to walk, from avenue to avenue, passing and repassing
his “Paradise Lost,” shooting fiery glances from his
eyes upon the indiscreet possessor of the coveted seat;
but this last, took no notice of the menacing looks of
our unhappy and irritated old friend, and continued
peacefully to sun himself whilst gazing with melancholy
eye upon the joyous circle of young girls who
danced up almost to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun neared the horizon—the shadows began to
lengthen—and, at last, twilight overspread the landscape;
then the unknown arose, and making a turn or
two to relieve his limbs, slowly disappeared by the
Rue St. <a id='hon'></a>Honoré.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Anspach returned home in feverish exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning the sun again shone out
beautifully, and our friend the major proceeded to
finish elaborately his toilet. He had grown calm, and
reason suggested that yesterday’s intruder could have
no motive, for two days in succession, to make him
miserable; nevertheless the old gentleman was unhappy—for
at his age a day lost is something!</p>

<p class='pindent'>On arriving at the Tuileries, the first object to which
he directed his longing eyes was his bench, and there
again was seated his perverse old substitute. The
major was astounded! He made a move as if to go
and tear the invader from a place of happiness of
which he was so unjustly deprived; but old age controls
impulse, and the major felt that he could not
depart from those rules of politeness which belonged
to his rank and former position in society. It was a
flagrant imposition it was true: there was even a kind
of impertinence in the conduct of the intruder, who
must have observed how much the major was chagrined
by his adverse possession the day before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was plausible, but it would not justify a
quarrel: and, whatever the right of the major to the
estate shaded with roses and jasmine, its assertion at
first view offered something so absurd, and even
ridiculous, that it hardly consorted with the dignity of
the descendant by the female side of the last Dukes of
Lorraine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These reflections, which presented themselves confusedly
to the mind of the major, as he wended his
tedious way among the walks, did not however calm
his irritation. He wandered without object among
the cross-alleys of the garden, running against passengers,
and even the trees and benches, and chairs, like
a dismasted ship at the mercy of winds and waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was really painful to see that long overcoat trotting
about, going, turning, and returning, its owner
given up to a thousand diverse emotions, in which
were intermixed chagrin, unhappiness and regret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As often as this changeful temper brought the old
man opposite to his lost Eden—that is to say, the bench
and bower of roses where imperturbably sat his rival,
the major raised his eyes upward and heaved so
lamentable a sigh that the passers by, not knowing the
cause, were struck with wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Major Anspach returned, timid,
nervous, breathless, and filled with inquietude—there
again was the <span class='it'>executioner of his happiness</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again in the morning M. Anspach dragged
himself to the spot, without strength and without hope—he
could scarcely raise his longing eyes from afar
toward his terrestrial paradise, where, as usual, sat his
tormentor, like the implacable angel of destruction;
that impassive face, that form, as long, as thin, as venerable
as the major’s own, but infinitely more enduring
in its cruelty—than the patience of its victim!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This excitement could not last without seriously
affecting the major’s health; he took to his bed; a
burning fever raged in his blood; weeks of unconsciousness
passed by, and a long convalescence only
permitted him to walk slowly along the Boulevard,
with cane, and umbrella to shade him from the influence
of the raging Dog Star; he sighed deeply and
constantly. When his thoughts rested upon his past
happiness, the wounds opened afresh, and he would
stand for a long time plunged in melancholy reverie,
interrupted only by nervous tremblings and audible
groans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, at last, he was entirely able to resume his
walks, instead of revisiting the Tuileries, he studiously
avoided them, and turning his course by the Rue du
Bac, passed on to the Luxembourg; he wished to cheat
his heart. But the effort was unsuccessful notwithstanding
his heroism—the habits of old age are tenacious
because they are egotistic. The Luxembourg
presented no object that he loved, neither the people
he was accustomed to see, nor the palace of his kings,
which at times he had worshiped with stolen glances;
neither the kindly memories of the past, suggested by
the sight of objects on the other side of the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of some days, the major felt that he
would infallibly return to his bed if he continued to
quarrel with his inclinations; but in the apprehension
of again meeting his adversary—whom he had come
to regard with a mixture of hatred and fear—he conceived
a most extravagant project. It is necessary, in
order to admit for a moment that such an idea could
enter the mind of one with head as gray as that of the
major, to reflect that the infatuation of the old man, instead
of relaxing during the paroxysms of fever, and
passing away with its weakness, only became concentrated
and fixed as an incurable mania.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever it was, he resolved to put it in execution
the very day of its conception, if necessity forced him.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Palsambleu!” the old major exclaimed to himself,
as he crossed the Pont Royal; “I have an idea that
things have changed a little in three months in ‘Little
Provence,’ and that my gentleman, tired of waiting to
see my chagrin, has vacated his place—or at least
some new rascal has taken it into his head to finish
the other’s work; that is, to disgust me with existence.
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
Bah! that’s all nonsense, I shall find my little bench
smaller than ever—if however Fortune is still against
me—then, mille diables, I will show him that I am a
Phalsbourg—morbleu!—a descendant of the Lorraines,
corbleu!—a gray musqueteer!—bombs and cannon!—and
we will see whether this fellow will keep his
ground. It is indifferent to me whether I die by the
stroke of a sabre, or of a little bench usurped. By the
bye! how long is it since my last duel? Let me see!
forty two years! Humph! that’s rather a long interval
for the honor of Phalsbourg. But that duel had
great results, and cost me dear—one hundred thousand
crowns! I would like to know whether my money
went to the bottom of the sea with that Palissandre—whom
may Heaven confound! When I think that we
endeavored to cut each other’s throats for that little
sinner Guimard!—a little fool! who had no other
merit, on my conscience, but that she was her mother’s
daughter—another adventuress who so completely
turned inside out the pockets of the infatuated and unfortunate
Soubise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Anspach hummed a tune as he lounged along
with a most gallant air in the long brown <span class='it'>scabbard</span>
which he called his overcoat, and which gave something
so extravagant to his appearance, that the gate-keeper
at the Tuileries had some remorse for letting
him pass: nevertheless, the major, when he had entered
the orangery, resumed his gravity and dignified
deportment; besides, he stretched out his neck and
held his head so proudly, that his length was increased
beyond all conception, giving one an idea of the sword
of a Swiss guard perambulating the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The promenade offered that day every imaginable
splendor—the sunlight danced upon the liquid surface
of the fountains, and its red rays piercing the interstices
of the foliage, bathed the atmosphere in glittering
vapor—the rays of warm light striking upon the
marble statues, started them as it were into being,
while Reverie, with bended head, seemed to throw its
somniferous influence over flowery meads and shaded
walks—and Zephyr, escorted by voluptuous Idleness,
sought each wooded recess like a nymph of Délos
under the sacred laurel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We dare not affirm that our ex-musqueteer sensibly
enjoyed the delights of the garden, thus illumined by
the morning sun as we have described them, for it is
the opinion of philosophers that a less pleasure is swallowed
up in a greater one—the little bench, its roses
and jasmine, alone entered his thoughts, and at that
moment for it alone he lived. His eyes on approaching
it were directed timidly toward the little seat, and
who can describe the bounding pulsation of his heart
on perceiving it vacant! And besides, how much was
it embellished since he last beheld it! the roses had
climbed up and mingled with the jasmine, and formed
a delicious bower of perfume and beauty, almost concealing
the little bench in its deep recesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred thousand pounds weight, and something
more, slid from the heart of the dear old major, and
enabled him for the first time in three months to breathe
freely. His emotion was so great that his limbs tottered,
and he was obliged to cling to an orange tree for
support—tears sprang to his eyes—he tried to utter
some words to himself that he might hear his own
voice, as if he doubted the evidence of his senses—but
he could only bring forth inarticulate sounds whilst his
chest heaved convulsively. He fell into a reverie.
“The storm that lowered on his house” was about to
be dissipated, and he had now only to combat the unhappy
daughter of Memory—talon-fingered Regret!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In celebrating thus in thought his returning happiness
Major Anspach resumed his march, and walked
along with eyes cast down, as if overcome with his
own pleasant thoughts, when he raised them he was
within two feet of his Mecca. He suddenly bounded
backward as if an adder had stung him, and then stood
breathing wildly and with glassy stare—his rival was
there!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader would be wrong to conclude that the ill
opinion formed in the mind of Major Anspach regarding
the unknown was a just one. The face of the old
man was wrinkled like that of an old soldier of Italy,
as painted by M. Charlet, giving evidence of years of
hardship spent in the service of his country—and if his
countenance was somewhat austere, that severity in
his looks was softened by something of amiability and
sweetness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was easy to perceive that he had suffered much
and long. His person partook of the military rigidity
of his countenance, the blue coat he wore over a white
waistcoat buttoning to the throat, with nankeen pantaloons,
and buckled shoes, indicated a fashion long gone
by, and its well-brushed surface, though worn, presented
to the eye a tout ensemble which claimed the
respect of the stranger. In a word, there existed between
the unknown and the major so many points of
resemblance, that it required the blind aversion which
had taken possession of the latter to prevent a feeling
of the warmest sympathy springing up between him
and his antagonist: but far from perceiving these symptoms
of a poverty noble and proud in his rival, and
which should have inclined him to stretch out the arms
of a brother rather than those of an enemy, the descendant
of the Phalsbourgs, blinded with rage, could
scarce recover himself sufficiently to salute the stranger
with a touch of his beaver of very sinister augury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unknown returned the salutation with much
urbanity and self-possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Anspach, this duty to politeness performed, mechanically
as it were, drew his hat down over his eyes
and made a step forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this gesture his rival smiled, and looked around
him as if to make his visiter comprehend that it was
impossible from the narrowness of his quarters to offer
him hospitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Anspach observing this pantomime, smiled also,
but it was a bitter smile. He made increditable efforts
to recover his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I see in you a lover of the Tuileries,”
observed he of the blue coat, bowing gracefully, “and
that you have come, like myself, to enjoy here the fine
weather?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is three months since I have enjoyed it, sir,” the
choking major answered, rolling his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True—I have remarked your absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” growled M. Anspach de Phalsbourg.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>
That “<span class='it'>ah!</span>” was a little fiendish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You appear to suffer,” rejoined he of the blue coat,
“and are fatigued,” he added, without offering, however,
to yield his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” replied the major, all at once recovering
the use of his epiglottis. “Yes, sir! I <span class='it'>am</span>
fatigued—no one was ever more fatigued.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The major made a pause as if gathering himself up
for an encounter—then stepping up boldly under the
very nose of his adversary, continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear me, my very <span class='it'>dear</span> sir. I have not the honor
to know you, but I take you to be an honorable man;
besides, your exterior pleases me; you suit me well,
and I should be pleased if you will permit me the
honor of cutting your throat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blue coat drew back in astonishment, mingled
with fright; he began to think he had to deal with an
insane person, but the major, interpreting the movement,
continued⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not judge the horse by his harness”—assuming
at the same time a port full of dignity and well-bred
self-possession. “You will have in me an antagonist
not unworthy of the sword of a man of honor—and if
reasons altogether personal did not at present oblige
me to ask as a favor the permission to conceal my
name, you would learn that I was of a blood which
has never dishonored the veins through which it ran.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, sir,” replied the unknown, in a tone almost
serious, “I am delighted by the accident, whatsoever
it may be, that brings us together; for the name I bear,
though I boast not of it, is one of the most esteemed
in Angoumois.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This meeting is delightful!” chimed in the major.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless,” resumed our blue coat, rising as
he spoke—“perhaps you will do me the pleasure to
explain to me to what unexpected cause I owe the
honor of your challenge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have it in few words. You have not
formally insulted me, I acknowledge, but you have
nearly killed me—and I plainly perceive from the
course you have taken that you will eventually accomplish
it. I prefer to anticipate my end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unknown reseated himself; for the idea returned
that he was conversing with a lunatic. But
this time the major, appearing to comprehend most
perfectly the suspicions of his enemy, shrugged his
shoulders and smiled in disdain, as he said⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hoped that your age, sir, would have prevented
any precipitate judgment concerning my motives; but
I see that I was mistaken, for you appear to partake of
that vulgar prejudice which puts beyond the pale of a
just opinion all that apparently outrages the conventionalities
of social life. Be pleased, then, to excuse
the strangeness of my address, and I dare hope that
you will reconsider your opinion, when you know the
just grounds I have to seek the honor of a meeting
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The composed and self-possessed manner with
which these last words were spoken, struck the unknown,
and he again stood up, while the major, throwing
a rapid glance over the blue coat, continued—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe, sir, you are in a condition to feel some
sympathy for those whom fortune has not deigned to
favor. I can, then, without a blush acknowledge to
you that I am one of her victims. Happily, I have
not received in the New World, where I passed many
years, severe lessons of wisdom and moderation without
profiting somewhat by them. I have been twice
entirely ruined, and yet am consoled by my philosophy.
Returning from America, I saw myself neglected—even
repulsed—by my royal masters, to whom I had
consecrated the best years of my life—a king—princes
who have not deigned to extend the hand of friendship
to an old and faithful servant, and who let him grow
old in indigence and want. Well, I am still resigned,
and for more than ten years have lived without complaint,
in a state bordering on the extremest misery.
But you know, sir, that man’s strength is not inexhaustible—there
is a point beyond endurance—it is to
that point you, sir, have brought me⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, sir? I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will see, sir. The necessity I was under to
contract my desires has conducted me, little by little,
to a modesty of enjoyment which will astonish you.
Our desires increase with fortune; but a wise man
has strength of mind enough to diminish them in inverse
ratio to his misfortunes. Mine, sir, are concentrated
upon an object so humble that I might well believe
it beyond the caprice of destiny. The object of
which I speak is the little bench where you are seated—where,
since the 17th of April, you, sir, have come
to seat yourself each day, a little earlier than it was
my custom to come out to rest myself. For two years
I have taken a fancy to this spot in the garden. I love
that bench—that shade—those flowers. In summer I
come here in the sweet morning hour, peacefully to
enjoy the perfume of these honeysuckles. In autumn—in
winter—the smallest ray of sunshine upon the
corner of the garden wall reflects its heat upon that
narrow bench, making it a delightful resting-place for
the worn out frame of an old man. What shall I say?
This sweet resort obtained soon such an empire over
me, that I had but one end—but one desire to gratify—the
least sunshine upon the roofs which my garret
overlooks—the least smile of heaven had for me, a
poor old man, more intoxicating charms than ever
glance of a mistress to the most devoted lover. It was
a real passion—a love with all its joys and delicious
griefs—a cloudy or a rainy day threw me in despair,
and I felt all the torments of absence from the thing I
loved—but was the morrow beautiful, I made the
most brilliant toilet I could imagine, and ran to my
little bench, convinced that I should find its pleasures
increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it necessary to tell you now, sir, that since the
17th of April you have driven me from my paradise,
and that you have become my executioner!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have but little more to say but that when I was
a gray musqueteer I would have killed any one who
raised his eyes toward my mistress; you, sir, have done
more than raise your eyes toward her—you have robbed
me of her—you have taken my little bench. It is
more than an insult. It is, believe me, a murder—an
assassination. Then, sir, give me again that seat;
assure me on your honor that you will respect my
right in future, or name your place and weapons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
The unknown listened to the major with increasing
interest; the impress of a thousand contrary feelings
flitted by turns across his countenance, and an observer
might have remarked at times that lively combats
were going on within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When M. Anspach ceased to speak, waiting the
answer of our blue coat, the latter walked backward
and forward for some time in silence, a prey to a
visible sorrow, which the major could not but respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he stopped, and fixing upon the major a
grave and melancholy look, replied⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am an old soldier, and the alternative you offer
is not repugnant to me. I, too, for three months have
had the habit of resorting to this sweet spot, and to it
I have consecrated the last enjoyments of a life without
happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak of your misfortunes,” added he, with a
serious smile; “mine do not cede to them in number
or severity: I was noble and wealthy before the
Revolution, but on my return, after a long absence, I
found France republican, and I too became a republican
from love to her. My nobility was opposed to
public opinion—I renounced it. My wealth appeared
to insult the public poverty—I offered my entire fortune
upon the altar of my country. The enemy
menaced our frontiers—I hastened to join the phalanx
under Moreau. I gave my all to France—my name,
my blood, my fortune. But Bonaparte appeared, and
nothing remained for me to offer to the expiring Republic
but my tears and my despair. Advances were
made to me—I rejected them. They would have restored
my fortune and my rank—I preferred my honor
and my misery—and it was only in 1815, when France
made a last effort, that I prepared to die at Waterloo.
Alas! much better would it have been to have died
there! Prisoner, and designedly overlooked in the
exchanges, (for you are aware that it could not be
forgiven to a count to have fought for France,) I was
banished to the end of Russia, dragged to Tobolsk,
and abandoned there without resources to all the horrors
of nakedness and hunger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How I escaped from those deserts would not interest
you. Heaven has permitted me to revisit
France, and here I am a mark for the resentments of
the throne; regarded as a traitor to the monarchy, and
contemned by those who to-day might aid me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man on concluding these words slowly
crossed his arms upon his breast, his head drooped,
as if memory remounted the lapse of years of misfortune,
and without apparent consciousness of the presence
of his interlocutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The major, let us say it to his praise, had equally
lost sight of the subject of their quarrel. Touched by
this recital, which awakened in his heart sensibilities
somewhat moss-grown by age, he approached the unknown,
and placing his hand upon his arm, said in a
voice filled with emotion⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Providence has had its secret designs, my dear
count, (for I perceive you bear that title,) in permitting
two unfortunates such as we are to cross each other’s
path; and if I experience something soothing to my
pain in listening to the recital of your sorrows, it is in
thinking that you have met the only person in the
world capable of sympathizing with you as you deserve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget, my dear sir,” replied the blue coat,
smiling blandly, “that we have to cut each other’s
throats to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The major hung his head in confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear me,” said the old soldier of the Republic.
“I do not really think that this affair is important
enough to fight about. Confess, besides, that such
pastime does not become our age. Ah! there was a
time I did not say so! In coming from the theatre, I
as willingly went to fight at the Porte Maillôt as to
laugh at the Café Procope. Sir, would you believe
it, he who speaks to you has fought and been wounded,
and afterward voyaged six thousand miles to seek his
antagonist, and all because one evening Mademoiselle
Guimard, the younger, let her handkerchief fall!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I hear!” exclaimed Major Anspach,
making a start of surprise, “you said—you—ah! mon
Dieu!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I see! you tremble—you become pale—do
you know any thing of that unhappy affair? Ah!
sir, if it is true that you do, render me a service that I
will never forget—tell me what has become of Major
Anspach?—but now I think of it, you said you had
been a gray musqueteer under the Comte D’Artois—perhaps
you have known the major—you certainly
must have been acquainted with him—ah! speak. I
only possess six hundred francs of revenue, but I
would give it all only to see the major once more before
I die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are then the Chevalier De Palissandre?”
murmured the grand-nephew of the Guises by the female
line, who had fallen upon the little bench from a
faintness he in vain endeavored to overcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I inherited the title of count on the death of my
two brothers, but you, sir—may I believe—my eyes do
not deceive me!—those features! Oh, speak once
more—you are⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, count. I am—I am your ancient rival—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, joy! Heaven is just—it would not let me
perish without seeing him once more. Oh! if you
knew, my dear baron, how often since your departure
from France—your flight I may call it—I have cursed
the ill-fortune which did not allow me to arrive in London
in time to join you—I was acquainted with the
rascality of your banker, and not wishing to entrust to
his hands the fortune which you had left in your carriage,
I hastened after you to inform you of it—to
advise you of your danger of loss through him in time
to remedy it. Missing you there, I did not feel myself
relieved of the obligation to seek you. I followed you
to the Havana—I pursued your traces, but meeting
contrary winds and tempests, the vessel in which I
embarked failed to overtake you, and I was obliged to
renounce the dearest object of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, chevalier—that is to say, sir count—pardon
me the neglect. Take the hand I offer you, and let us
bless the good fortune which permits us to meet in our
unhappy circumstances, in which we both have need
of the friendly offices of the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil do you say, D’Anspach?” cried the
count, crushing in his own the offered hand of the
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
major. “What do you say about unhappy circumstances?
There are none hereafter for you, my friend—you
are rich, devilish rich—I believe, devil take me!
that you are a monstrous millionaire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old major fixed his eye on De Palissandre in
stupid astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Notwithstanding your surprise, it is nevertheless
true,” continued the count, “for despairing of ever
seeing you again, I took the only course which remained,
which was to wait until you should yourself
return to seek your 300,000 francs. But not wishing
to resemble the bad servant in the parable who buried
his talent in the earth, and not believing your money
safe in France, I returned to London, placed your little
fortune in the hands of one of my friends connected
with the East Company—and remember, major, that
forty years have passed away since that! May I go
to the devil, if I can pretend to tell you what the
honorable baronet has done to multiply your francs; but
his son, who succeeded him in business fifteen years
ago, and with whom I have corresponded since my
return from Russia, wrote me the other day that the
funds invested in the house of Ashburton &amp; Co.
amounted to nearly eight hundred thousand pounds
sterling—twenty millions of francs! It seems like a
fairy tale!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will not attempt to paint the expression upon
the face of Major Anspach. He remained for a long
time without speech or color—his eyes shut—like a
man half-killed by some overwhelming blow, and who
seems bewildered in his mind—at length his features
regained their natural appearance, his cheeks their
color; he drew a long sigh, opened his eyes, and saw
before him M. de Palissandre anxiously watching the
effect of the crisis—stretched out his arms and threw
them around the neck of his old friend; shedding torrents
of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the first effervescence of feeling was a little
subdued, the major seized the hand of the count anew.
“Hear me, Palissandre—if you do not promise me
to submit yourself without the slightest remark to my
wishes, I take to witness my great grand-aunt, who
was cousin in the eighth degree removed of Monsieur
de Guise le Balafré, that I will go to London, receive
my millions, and on my return will throw them into
the sea. Ma foi! it will only be the second fortune
old ocean owes to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sarpejeu! speak then!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, we will live together—be happy—be
rich together—and <span class='it'>both shall have new suits of
clothes</span>!—and when we have lived long enough, I
hope Heaven will put an end to us both at the same
time. I shall give immediate orders for the purchase,
at whatever cost, of the lands of De Phalbourg and
our Castle de Palissandre. Then we shall have two
fine estates, and you will see what lots of nephews
and nieces, who do not know us to-day, will spring
out of the earth as it were, expressly to continue the
rank and blood of the two noble houses. We shall
not want for heirs, depend upon it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two friends again embraced each other—the
treaty was concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the count and baron, with arms interlaced,
marched from the Tuileries with a step which would
have done honor to two voltigeurs of Louis Quinze—</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the little seat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We feel ashamed to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth. Yes, dear lady reader,
Major Anspach in departing forgot to salute even with
a parting glance that little embowered seat, perfumed
with jasmine and rose—the object of so much tender
regard, and for which a single hour ago he was willing
to risk cutting throats with a stranger. Alas! Mademoiselle,
love will not last forever even at sixty years!
Nevertheless, it must be confessed the little bench,
like your sex, soon obtained consolation.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the margin of a blue stream that ran singing
through a lonely valley among the green hills of New
England, there stood in the olden time, a low cottage,
built of logs, and half covered with woodbine and wild
honeysuckle. The small patch of Indian corn near it
hardly deserved the name of a garden, and the dense
forests that surrounded it, showed that as yet civilization
had penetrated but little way into the wilds of
the new world. Yet the variety of wild flowers which,
transplanted from their native glades, blossomed around
the low doorway, and the air of neatness that pervaded
the rude establishment, proved a degree of refinement
greater than was usual among the Indian tribes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now the hour of twilight, and not a sound
was heard save the low murmuring of the wind as it
swept through the dark recesses, and swayed the
tangled branches of the mighty forest-trees. In one of
the two small rooms into which the cottage was divided,
an aged Indian and his squaw were seated beside
a rude couch, where lay the form of a dying woman.
Her delicate complexion and light hair betrayed
her English origin, and she was still young,
and had once been beautiful, though her face bore the
traces of a wo more heavy than the weight of years.
Yet peace was there, and the smile of calm resignation
which rested upon her features, told that not in
vain had been the sorrow which had bowed her to
the grave. At the foot of the couch stood a missionary—one
of those holy men whose lives of toil and suffering
were passed in the vain endeavor to counteract the
effects of the vices introduced among the Indians by
their foreign oppressors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chieftain lifted his head from his breast and
said, in a low tone, “She is passing away. The fair
flower we would have cherished upon our hearts is
withered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these words the dying woman opened her eyes,
and a smile broke over her pale face as she said,
“Mourn not for me, kind father; and thou, tender
mother, weep no more. Ye would not keep a bird
from its native sky, that its song might cheer you.
Even like a bird my spirit would spread its wings that
it may fly away and be at rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian mother raised her eyes wildly and
wrung her hands as she gazed on her adopted child.
Then swaying her body to and fro, she murmured in
the half singing half wailing tones of an Indian lament,
“Will not our hut be very desolate, my bird, when
thy song is hushed; and who will bring us light like
the light of thy starry eyes? Shall we not miss thy
voice at eventide when we kneel to the God thou hast
taught us to worship? Leave us not—leave us not,
for our life goes with thee to the grave!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The missionary raised his hands to heaven, and a
lofty faith spoke in his voice, as he said, “Mourn ye
not, nor weep. The exile departeth for her native
land, the wanderer for her father’s house. A light is
fading from your path, but another star shall soon be
added to the Redeemer’s crown. The flower ye would
have cherished hath drooped amid these alien skies,
but it shall bloom in fresher beauty in the Paradise
above.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he finished speaking, the dying lady placed in his
hands a manuscript, bidding him read it when she was
dead; and then, with one farewell look of love on the
kind faces that surrounded her, she closed her eyes
wearily, and crossing her small white hands upon her
breast, she composed herself as if to sleep. There was
a long silence, broken only by the low wailing of the
Indian woman, as she murmured in an under tone,
“The way is long, the way is dark; oh, bird of the
bright eye, thou soarest out of sight! who shall tell us
the path to the spirit-land when thy singing voice is
hushed? Wo for us! wo, wo—for the way is dark!”
Gradually these low moans seemed to reach the ear
that was fast closing to earthly sounds. The lips of
the dying moved, as if in a vain effort to speak, and at
length, in faint tones, she whispered, “They shall be
gathered out of every kindred and tribe and nation, and
there shall be one fold and one Shepherd. I know—I
know that my Redeemer liveth.” A brilliant smile
lighted her whole face with an expression of triumph,
as she uttered these words of hope, and even in speaking
them, the spirit fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening the missionary opened the manuscript.
It read as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been kind to me, and have respected the
sacred silence of the sorrow which has worn out my
life. There are moments when every heart yearns
for sympathy, and the long closed fountains of the soul
flow again. Such a mood is on me now, and therefore
I open to you this long-sealed heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of my childhood I will say little, save that it passed
like a fairy revel. Heiress of unbounded wealth, and
last of a long-descended and honorable family, I was
loved with a lavish and doating fondness, until a sudden
and terrible disease, that cut down my parents in
the pride and glory of their days, left me an orphan.
From that grief, which, for a time, was so violent as
to threaten the destruction of life and reason, I never
fully recovered. Even when change of scene, the
progress of time, and the natural elasticity of youth
had so far changed me, that I appeared to have forgotten
my sorrow, there lay ever upon my heart the shadow
of the tomb. After a time I was sent to reside with
my aunt, at the north of England. She was waiting
in the castle gate to receive me when I arrived there,
and beside her rode her only son—my Cousin Gerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
“How slight a thing may seal the whole future of our
lives. We greet with a careless word and a momentary
glance those whose fate is to color our own forever,
and then pass on unthinking that henceforth our
destiny is fixed. And yet the first time I saw him his
image was stamped on my heart. Sorrow, change,
wrong, despair have passed over it—but that image is
there still. As I write, the curtain of the past seems
drawn back, and again I greet thee, Gerald Bellamont.
Again I meet the gaze of those flashing eyes—I hear
the low, rich music of thy voice, and I feel the floods
of deep, unquenchable love, rising in my soul for thee—thou
loved so vainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Days, weeks and months passed on, and we spoke
not of love, perchance knew not that the fatal spell was
upon us. But at last the dream was broken—the hours
of peaceful affection passed away. Gerald left us for
a tour on the Continent, and with the struggle of that
first parting came the knowledge of all that we were
to each other—came the tumult, the trembling, the
fearfulness of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At first the tedious hours were relieved by frequent
letters from him, so full of tender affection,
and withal so overflowing with youthful enjoyment of
the new scenes around him, that even my fond heart
was content to have him absent. Then letters came
more seldom—then ceased altogether—and then, in
the midst of our wonder and anxiety, he appeared suddenly
in his old home; but so changed from the merry-hearted
boy to the reserved, thought-stricken man, that
my timid nature was abashed, and I dared not question
him concerning the change which I <span class='it'>felt</span> had come
over his inmost being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were wedded; and if I detected, even amid the
bridal festivities, a shade of sadness on my husband’s
brow, I strove to console myself with the hope that
now he was mine—mine forever; the love so deep,
so self-sacrificing, which I would every moment lavish
upon him, could not but chase away the bitter memories
which oppressed him. Residing on my own estate
near London, our house was the resort of the noble
and the gay; and amid the exciting whirl of this new
life, little time was left for anxious thought. I entered
into the pleasures which surrounded me with the zest
of a young and joyous heart; and for a few months life
was filled with sunshine—and the hours flew swiftly
away; ah! why came so soon that night of agony on
which there dawned no morrow.</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'>“I was dressed at last—ready for the fancy ball.
My costume, which had been selected by Lord Bellamont,
had been pronounced perfect by my maids, and
even my fastidious taste could suggest no improvement.
After one parting glance of satisfaction at the mirror
which reflected my brilliant figure, I descended to the
library, where I knew Gerald waited for me, expecting
to be welcomed with that smile of admiration which
woman so highly prizes from the lips of love. To my
surprise, Gerald did not turn at my entrance; and as I
approached the window where he sat, I found him
gazing at a small picture, with which he was so intently
occupied as to be unconscious of my presence.
It was a full-length female figure. She stood with one
arm thrown across a lyre, and one raised to heaven.
A long, dark curl had strayed from her bandeau of
pearls and rested on her neck, and the hair was parted
back smoothly from her high brow. The face was
passing beautiful, with a fire in the dark eyes, and on
the small mouth, an air of lofty determination which
might have become a priestess at the altar of sacrifice.
Beneath was written—Leonore St. Clair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I stood behind him, hesitating how to break his
revery, Gerald started up suddenly, and tearing the
picture to pieces, threw the fragments out of the window,
where the night wind scattered them far and wide.
He watched them with a look made up of scorn and
grief, and was turning away with a sigh, when he first
saw me standing near him. A deep flush passed over
his face, and he looked earnestly, almost sternly at me
for a few moments. I was as much confused as himself,
though I scarce knew why, but I had sufficient
command of myself to ask some question about the
picture—I know not what. Folding me in his arms,
he kissed me again and again before he answered. ‘I
will tell you about it some time—do not ask me now.
I thought it destroyed long ago, until by accident I
found it to-night. It is a relic of something I must
forget—I would gladly forget;’ and he pressed me passionately
to his heart, with words of deep tenderness.
Was I mad, was I blind, that even then no foreboding
whisper told my heart its doom? Yet at that moment I
thought only that he was unhappy; and when I saw him
smile again, the suspicion fled, that for a moment had
disturbed me, and, gayest of the gay, proudest of the
proud, I mingled with the throng which filled the
saloons of Lady Gordon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Late in the evening, as leaning on the arm of Lord ——,
I wandered from room to room, seeking refuge
from the crowd and the oppressive heat, we found our
way into the library, where but few had collected.
As we entered, we were greeted by a strain of music
so sweet and thrilling, that I involuntarily pressed forward
to listen. On a sofa near us the musician was
seated. One arm, exquisitely moulded, and white as
snow, was thrown across a harp, as she drew from the
strings a few simple notes. She was dressed in white
satin, which was not more purely beautiful than her
complexion, and was without ornament, save a few
pearls that gleamed among the braids of her raven hair,
and on her bosom she wore a single white rose—its
leaves were withered. The instant I saw her, I had
a dim recollection of having seen that face before, and
while I was striving to recall the time and place, she
commenced singing. Never heard I music like the
melody she uttered. It might have been thought the
voice of an angel chanting the songs of heaven; but,
alas! though the voice was of heaven, the song
was earthly. She <a id='sang'></a>sang of love—not the happy love
of that better land, but sad, broken-hearted, such
as woman’s hath too often been—utterly vain and
hopeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this moment I was startled by a deep sigh near
me, and looking up, saw Gerald standing in the deep
shadow of the window recess. He was gazing on the
singer, who sat directly before him. The lady heard
the sigh—their eyes met, and the glance which flashed
from them, spoke volumes. For a moment she seemed
confused and agitated, then with a look of proud
anguish, and a voice that faltered not in its clear, low
tones, she finished the song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her lips quivered, and her pale cheek became
crimson as she concluded, and I fancied tears trembled
in the depths of her dark, radiant eyes. She turned
her face toward Gerald, and for a moment they continued
gazing on each other with a look full of sorrowful
love, of agony and despair. It was not till she had
left the room that I found strength to speak. ‘Who
is she?’ I asked. The answer told me the whole
story. It was Leonore St. Clair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When and how he had met her I knew and thought
not. It was enough to know that she loved him—that
his whole soul was given to her, and that I—oh God!
I was unbeloved. My brain seemed to burn, and my
heart ceased to beat—and yet I did not faint. There
is a fearful strength in woman’s heart, of which she is
unconscious till the hour of her uttermost agony.
Turning from the brilliant scene, I passed through the
window into the garden. There was one walk which
had been left unlighted, and thither my steps were
bent. It led to a small temple, which had been erected
to Cupid, and a lamp that hung over the altar, showed
the figure of the sleeping boy; but the recesses of the
temple were in deep shadow. I entered, and threw
myself on a seat in the darkest corner. Was it <span class='it'>chance</span>,
or was it ordered by the mysterious Providence which
revealed to me the fearful secret that was to blight my
happiness forever?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I lay there striving to still the tumult of my
thoughts, footsteps approached, and Leonore St. Clair
entered, followed by my husband. She cast a hurried
glance around, but saw me not, and then turning to
him, said, haughtily, ‘Leave me, rash man. Is it not
enough that you once cold and cruelly deceived me,
but must you thus force yourself into my presence, and
revive the memory of feelings I deemed long since dead.
Leave me—I command you!’ and she motioned him
away with an impatient gesture. I leaned forward to
hear the reply. ‘Say not so, Leonore. Hear me—nay,
turn not away, for you must hear me. Long ere
I knew you I was betrothed to another. She was
gentle and beautiful; oh, dearest, can you blame me
that I shrunk from breaking her kind and faithful heart.
Would you have taken my hand if it were stained with
her tears? Would you have accepted a dishonored
name? Too well I knew you, too deeply had I read
your noble nature to dream of doing aught but to bow
in silence to my sad destiny. Nay, more, deeply,
wildly as I loved you, until that last day we spent together
on the Rhine, I knew not that I was beloved
in return; I had been told you were the promised bride
of another. Then, when I first knew that you were
free, and I—I bound to another; I cannot speak of this—I
cannot think of it; sometimes I fear I am going
mad.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not hear her answer, for as he spoke he drew
her to the steps of the altar, and they sat down together.
They conversed some time in a low tone, and I heard
the sound of weeping. At last they rose, and as the
light fell full on their faces, I saw they were both fearfully
agitated. She drew her hands from his with a
look of passionate despair. ‘Go, now,’ she said, ‘go,
while I have power to bid you leave me. God knows
I shall never forget you; but from this moment we
must never, never meet again.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I go,’ he replied, sadly; ‘yet ere we part, Leonore,
I ask one kiss—the first, the last. Let me press you
once to this heart, and it will be nerved to endure all
things.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She fell into his arms—he clasped her to his bosom,
and I saw their lips meet. Another moment and he
had turned from her. ‘Farewell!’ he said, in a low,
hoarse tone. ‘Farewell, <span class='it'>forever</span>!’ was the response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She remained standing until the sound of his steps
had died away, and then flung herself down heavily
on the marble floor. Even in that first hour of misery
I felt no hatred of her. I longed to creep to her bosom,
and mingle my tears with hers, and echo the sobs that
came thick and gaspingly from her lips. After a while
she rose slowly, and leaned against the altar, while
words came from her lips, faint at first, and broken, but
growing louder, till I could distinguish them. ‘To die—to
die! It would be but a moment of agony, and then
all is peace. Why should I tremble? What can the
world be to me henceforth but a living tomb? And he—the
vainly loved; ah! Gerald, were I gone forever—couldst
thou not soon learn to forget me? For thy
sake, beloved, I dare die.’ As she spoke she took from
her bosom a small phial, and as it passed before the light,
I saw it was full of a red liquid. Almost involuntarily
I sprung forward and dashed it to the ground as she
raised it to her lips. ‘Do not—do not commit murder!’ I
whispered breathlessly. She gazed at me wildly for a
few moments, pressed her hands to her brow, and
sunk fainting to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I supported her till she revived, and with her first
breath of consciousness she asked my name. I did
not reply. Just then we heard voices calling her. She
sprung up hastily, and I was astonished at her self-possession—for
I was new in the school of misery,
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
she poor thing, knew what it was to smile, while her
heart was breaking. For a while she buried her face
in her hands, and when she looked up, save a slight
trace of tears round her eyes, all trace of emotion had
vanished from her features. Seizing my arm as I stood
leaning for support against a pillar, she drew me forward
to the light, saying, in a tone too proudly bitter ever
to be forgotten, ‘You have seen and heard much—more
than could have been wrung by years of torture from
the proud heart of Leonore St. Clair. Yet when you
see me, you shall know how bravely a strong soul can
sustain itself when all its hopes are crushed, and life is
a burden. You shall see how my calm, haughty mien
shall fling defiance at you if you choose to publish my
secret. Tell me, girl—who are you?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I am the wife of Gerald Bellamont.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a start of horror and a faint cry, she dropped
my arm and fled from the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you wonder that I can think and write of this
with calmness? I tell you there have been moments
when, as the flood-gates of memory were opened, and
the buried past came rushing back over my soul, I
have cried out in my agony, and prayed to drink of the
blessed fountain of Lethe, and forget forever. But
this is past now. A higher faith hath taught me the
meaning of this fearful lesson, a higher hope sustains
me than was ever born of human love. Truly earth
hath no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night was far spent ere I reached my home.
My husband came soon after. I heard him enter his
chamber, and for a long time I listened to the sound
of his heavy steps as he paced the floor. At last he
threw himself on the bed, and then all was still. Nature
could endure no more, and I fell asleep. Wild
and terrible were the visions that flitted around my
couch. I was in a vast banqueting-hall, and with me the
companions of the last night’s revel. Again I saw the
flowers, the lights, the bright, happy faces, and again
the dancers whirled by me. The night waned, the stars
went out one by one, and daylight shone in on the
dying lamps; yet still those wild revelers flew by me.
The sun rose up and shed his fervent beams upon us.
The flowers faded, and the faces of the dancers grew
wan, and one by one they dropped down and died. The
twilight crept over the hills, and night came on—not
radiant with stars, and redolent with the breath
of flowers, but horribly dark—the realization of impenetrable
gloom. And slowly from out of that blackness
came forth the form of a woman, clothed in white,
and grasping a lyre, from the strings of which she drew
forth no sound. Over her head a veil was thrown,
hiding her face, and descending in wavy folds to her
feet. She moved not, breathed not—all was still as
the silence of the tomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Light rose no more upon me, but I saw all
things in that deep darkness more distinctly than
ever. <span class='it'>Years</span> passed over me. I saw the finger of
Time smite the walls of my prison-house, and they
crumbled to dust. The grass grew up from the decaying
floor, and became longer and longer, till its dull
rustling answered to the moaning wind. From the
dust of those beings, once so full of life and loveliness,
the ivy weed sprung and wound itself round the roofless
pillars till the vast charnel-house was green and
beautiful as a garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there came around me, as I stood there in
my awful solitude, faces and forms that looked out
fitfully from the darkness, and then disappeared. They
wandered around, they stood beside me, some gazing
on me with pale, spiritual faces, bright, yet mournful
in their loveliness, and some with the countenances of
fiends, that laughed horribly at my desolation. And
there was one form that took its place beside that
marble figure, and fixed upon me the glance of its
dark eyes, reaching forth its hands as if in vain efforts
to approach me. Amid a thousand phantoms I should
have known him—it was Gerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had borne all things else in my dreadful destiny,
but I could not bear the mournful expression of that
dear face. Tears, blessed tears came to my relief. I
sprung forward, the fetters that had bound me seemed
broken, and I would have flung myself into his arms,
when suddenly that long, motionless figure interposed
itself between us, and as her hand swept the lyre-strings,
there came from them a strain of unearthly
melody. It was repeated from the distance, and on its
pealing echoes there came the sound of voices mingled
with the tramping of many feet, and forth from the
darkness there came, two by two, a band, clothed in
garments of sable blackness, and girdled each with a
girdle of living fire; and on the girdle, and on the forehead
of each were written, in letters of blood, these
words, ‘forever and forever.’ They passed slowly by,
and in passing each turned and looked at me. I shuddered
at the sight, for it was like the faces of the damned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suddenly I felt myself seized and borne onward by
an invisible force. Then there rose on the air a low,
wailing anthem, that might have been the dirge of a
lost soul, and as it grew louder and nearer, directly
before me there seemed as it were a great curtain
rolled up, and I was in a vast cathedral. We stood
before the altar; around me were ranged that band of
fearful ones, with their burning girdles, and before me
the priest, dressed in his pontifical robes, and wearing
still that cincture of living fire. The marriage ceremony
proceeded—it was finished, and I turned to receive
the bridal kiss. The person at my side turned
also, and I saw his face—it was Gerald. With a cry
of joy I sprung forward to his embrace, when suddenly
there came that marble form between me and my beloved.
She fell into his arms, she was pressed to his
heart, she received the kiss which should have been
mine alone. Then rose again that strain of dirge-like
music—then pealed the shouts of fiendish, mocking
laughter; the whole scene vanished from my sight; I
felt the ground pass from under my feet, and from the
immense distance I heard a voice cry, ‘Come, come,
come—come to the judgment of the deceived and the
deceiver.’ With these words I felt myself borne
swiftly through the air. A giant’s strength would
have been vain against the force which held me—I
was powerless as an infant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We passed with the speed of a whirlwind through
the region of clouds and storm, and left star after star
behind us, till we reached the bounds of the visible
universe. Still there appeared system after system of
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
worlds, each with its suns and stars, and still our flight
was onward—onward, while ever and anon there came
through the blue ether, the echo of that awful summons,
‘Come, come, come!’ At length we reached
the bounds of inhabited space, and entered the lone
fields of chaos. And now faintly there came upon my
vision another star, which seemed flying on its way as
if pursued by the spirit of wrath. We approached it
rapidly—it was a world on fire. I saw forms that
wandered to and fro, striving in vain to fly from their
torments—‘hateful, miserable, and hating one another.’
They ran to and fro, they plunged into rivers that rolled
in sullen billows through that world of despair, and
shrunk back howling, for the waves were of liquid
fire. They glared horribly on one another with their
fiery eyes, and raised their hands with deep curses to
where, in the lurid sky above them, burned in blood-red
letters, the curse of their awful sentence, ‘forever
and forever!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon the verge of this fiery world we paused, and
for a few moments there was a deep and fearful silence.
Then the band of dark spirits opened their ranks and
led forth the form of a man. It was Gerald. I saw
them hover with him over the fiery abyss. I saw his
impotent struggles to escape; and breaking from the
power that held me, I cried, ‘I am thine, beloved—take
me with thee—in the midst of guilt and anguish,
thine, still thine!’ An instant more and I should have
reached him, when, with a wild laugh, <span class='it'>that</span> form came
again between us. Slowly she raised from her features
the shadowy veil—it was the face of Leonore.
With a sharp cry, I started from her. The spell which
had bound me was broken. In mercy I awoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trembling, scarcely daring to think it all a dream,
I drew aside the curtains to look around, and beheld
my husband standing before me. He was frightfully
pale and haggard, his eyes were dim and bloodshot,
and startled at his appearance, and for a moment half
forgetting the dreadful secret I had learned, I threw
my arms around him, and drew his face down to mine.
A deeper shade passed over his brow, and he sighed
heavily as he pressed his lips to my cheek. I could
not return the kiss. I could not speak. Perhaps he
did not notice my silence, for in a few moments he
told me that he had received letters requiring his immediate
presence in France, and had made preparations
to leave in a few hours. Some more words he
spoke, but I knew not what they were, and then clasping
me convulsively to his heart, he bade me try to
sleep again, and left me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sleep—oh mockery! What had I to do with sleep
or rest, while I bore within me the blight of a sleepless
wo! How may I tell of the weary days that succeeded?
At first there were hours of frantic misery—tears of
wild and passionate despair. Then came the silent
sorrow—the dull heart-aching that so slowly and
surely wears out the life. Had I loved Gerald less, I
might have called pride to my aid—I should have felt
resentment or jealousy, but judging him from the fullness
of my forgiving heart, I had none of these emotions,
which might have nerved me to forget my wrongs.
Once after that fatal night I saw Leonore at the Opera,
where I had been carried by the solicitations of my
friends. She was fearfully changed. The rich fullness
of her form was gone, the bloom had faded from her
cheek, and her eyes were dim, as if she too had wept
tears of vain sorrow. She sat among her gay and
splendid companions, silent, motionless, abstracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That night I returned home to find a new affliction.
Lights were flitting to and fro, and the servants avoided
me as I entered—for none cared to tell me the sad
tidings. Lord Bellamont had returned home violently
ill, and when I entered his bed-chamber, I found the
physician already there, striving to rouse him from
the stupor into which he had fallen. Sorrow and
sickness had written deep lines on that dear face, and
even amid the weakness of delirium he seemed to
battle with the strong heart’s agony. Seven days I
sat beside his pillow. I faltered not—I wearied not.
Seven nights I saw the twilight steal over the hills, and
the moon fade from the sky, and I slept not. Naught
but a love like mine could have endured these torturing
vigils. My whole being resolved itself into one intense
thought of him—one fervent prayer that he might not
go down in the noonday of his life and beauty to be a
dweller with the dead. For myself—my resolution
was taken. I would no longer be the living mildew
on his brightest hopes—the fetter that bound him from
all he loved best. Ah, woman’s heart is strong, and
He who formed it for love and sorrow, alone knows
how much it will endure ere it break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Religion forbade that I should for his sake give up
this mortal life, else I would willingly have died, but I
could give up the <span class='it'>life</span> of <span class='it'>life</span>—sacrifice all that made
earth joyous or beautiful—break the tie that bound him
to misery and to me. I could leave him. Poorly as
he had requited my love, he was still the chief pleasure
and glory of my existence. Even then to hear
his voice, to watch the return of health to his enfeebled
frame, to gaze upon his face in silence and unheeded,
was the sole happiness left me, and that, even that I
gave up for his sake. Ah, Gerald, could I know that
when free thy heart turned back once, only once, after
the lost one, I would not regret the sacrifice. Alas!
it was vain—all in vain. Let me hasten on, lest my
brain grow wild again with these fearful memories.</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>“My preparations were soon made. Fortunately
for my purpose, one of the servants had some relatives
who were to emigrate to America, and I had at
his request, supplied them with the requisite means. I
sent for him, and with a calmness at which I even then
wondered, I told him I wished to send under his care
a young friend, whom I requested him to treat with
respect and attention, as grief for the loss of a friend
had made him slightly insane. He promised to take
the charge, and appointed the place where I should
meet him, suspecting nothing of my design. Why
should he? Too well had that fatal secret been kept;
my nearest friends knew nothing of what had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The parting hour came too quickly. I was calm,
for there was neither hope nor fear in my heart. I
only knew that I must leave Gerald, and what else remained
to me in life. I stained my face till I was dark
as a gipsy, and cut off the long, silken tresses of which
I was once so proud. Then clothing myself in the
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
garments of my page, I secreted about my person a
small amount of money, and taking a bundle of clothes
in order to sustain my assumed character, I was ready
to depart. At the threshold of the door I paused, and
unable to go without seeing him once more, I stole
softly to the room where my husband lay sleeping; I
knelt by his couch, over which the moonlight fell
brightly, and gazed into his face with that earnest look
which a drowning man might give of earth and sky
ere the blue waters closed over him forever. As I
gazed, the sleeper stirred, a smile passed over his face,
and he spoke my name. That one word unnerved
me. Tears rose to my eyes, and hope, which I had
deemed long since dead, sent her low, thrilling whisper
through my heart. For a few moments I was swayed
with conflicting emotions, as visions of past days rose
before me. It was not long. Again came the thought
of the last few months of sorrow, and I could no longer
doubt. Rising with a new resolution, I went to the
table that stood near and wrote a few lines—the transcript
of my heart’s despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Farewell, Gerald—<span class='it'>I know all</span>; I can no longer
endure to be the cause of wo to you, whom I love far
more than life. Ere you read this I shall be gone from
you forever. Be happy, for I shall never return from
that last resting-place to cast a shadow over your soul.
God knows I blame you not. It was sufficient of
blessedness for me that I was worn a little while on
your heart, though I be now cast aside like a withered
weed to perish.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Folding the letter, I laid it on the pillow. Still he
slept, but the smile had faded from his face, and I bent
over him and pressed on his lips one last kiss—the seal
of my sacrifice. The touch disturbed him, and I paused
to catch the words that he spoke, as he turned restlessly
on his pillow—the last words I might hear from
him. It came—the word was ‘Leonore.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silently, as if that word had been a curse to cling
to me through life, I turned and left him. Without a
pause I tracked the mazes of the garden and the park—heedless,
tearless, miserable. As I came near to
the Park Lodge, lights were glancing in the cottage,
and a carriage stood at the door. The children were
already seated in it, and soon the parents came to the
door, and as I leaned exhausted against a tree, I saw
the parting, and heard the sound of low sobbings, of
blessings, and of prayers. Alas! I had departed, unblest,
unwept. I know not what spell was in the sound,
but in a moment I was collected and firm, and entering
the carriage I wrapped myself in my cloak, and as
they asked me no questions, we rode in silence from
the spot which contained all that was dear to me on
earth. Morning was breaking before we reached the
vessel, whose sails were spread, and her deck crowded
with passengers. A short time sufficed to place us
among them, and in a few moments the anchor was
weighed, and the vessel dropped down the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After this there is a long, long period of which I
remember nothing. The various incidents of our
voyage and our arrival in the new world, passed before
me like the vague and changing scenes of a dream.
The necessity for action taken away, my whole being
sunk into a sort of apathy, and heart and mind seemed
palsied. From this state I was roused by finding that
preparations were being made to send me back to England,
and a vague horror seized me at the thought,
though I had no recollection of the past. With the
cunning of insanity, I made no objection to the plan,
but one day, unnoticed, I rambled away from the
village, and for many days wandered on through the
woods without aim or motive, save the vague fear of
something behind. I remember reaching at last the
top of a high hill, amid a violent storm of thunder and
lightning, and there night closed around me, dark and
mirky, and beneath the pouring rain I lay down on a
bare rock and slept. There I was found next morning
by the Indian chief whose wigwam has from that time
been my home. A long sickness which ensued reduced
me to the brink of the grave, and for many
weeks I was insensible to the care of my kind nurses,
but their simple skill and constant attention at last
triumphed over the violence of disease, and I awoke
to reason and—wo is me—to a recollection of the long
hidden past.</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Gerald—it was my husband! Merciful
heaven! after so many years of painful separation did
we meet again!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had been sick and weak for some days, and my
Indian father had led me forth one sunny morning into
the green old woods, where I reclined, concealed by
flowering shrubs, upon the mossy trunk of an old tree.
Suddenly we heard the tramp of horses, and winding
along the narrow path came a band of armed men, and
their leader was Lord Bellamont. His face was stern
and pale, and there lay the weight of years which were
not his, in the thin, gray locks which floated over his
brow; yet at the first glance I knew him, and rising
almost unconsciously, I followed after him. Mile after
mile I went on unheeding, and my kind protector accompanied
me without a question, for he saw that a great
purpose nerved my feeble frame. When the noontide
heat had passed, we reached the top of a small hill,
and in an open level plain below, we saw hostile
armies arrayed for battle. One long hour I watched
the waving of that snow-white plume, hither and
thither among the soldiers, till at last it was struck
down. Horribly distinct even now is the agony of that
moment, when my straining eye was fixed on that spot
with an intensity which through the confused mêlée
of the fight never for one instant wavered. When the
course of the conflict swept the armies further down
the plain, I rose and went to the spot. I knew him—ghastly
and bleeding as he was, and God gave me
strength to know that he was dying, and yet to endure.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>“A few hours after he opened his eyes, and the pain
of his wounds seemed relieved. I had laid him on
my own bed, and was kneeling beside him. ‘Pray
for me,’ he said, faintly, ‘for I must die, and there is
guilt on my soul.’ I bowed my head lower, and tears
fell from my hot and aching eyes. As I listened to
that well-remembered voice, all the wild joy of our
first love came rushing back over my soul, and over-powered
by the recollection, I fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I recovered, they told me that the missionary
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
we had sent for had arrived and was with Gerald. I
crept silently into the room, and stood concealed behind
a screen, which had been arranged to protect the
sufferer from the draught of air. He was speaking in
a low, mournful tone, but I heard every word distinctly.
‘It was a wild, and sad, but not a guilty love,’
he said. ‘My own heart would have scorned me, had
I brought shame on the young head I have bowed even
to the grave with a weight of sorrow too heavy to be
borne. I looked upon Ella in her young beauty, and
strove to forget the dark, spiritual eyes of Leonore.
We were wedded—Ella and I—and when I spoke the
bridal vows, it was with a heart as pure as if she
whose destiny had been so fatally linked with mine,
was what she now is, an angel in heaven, I loved her;
but that hopeless and ideal passion was only part of
my remembrance of the beautiful scenes of sunny
Italy; and while those sad thoughts chastened all present
joy, they interfered not with the love I bore for
Ella. Perhaps, had I understood better the deep,
thoughtful nature of my gentle and joyous bride, I had
after a while forgotten Leonore. But, wrapped in
painful musings, I heeded not the manifestations of her
sensitive nature, and regarded her only as the play-fellow
of my thoughtless youth—too airy and brilliant
to understand my saddened heart.’ He paused for a
few moments, and then continued, in an agitated tone,
‘We met once more—Leonore and myself—oh, that I
had died ere that evening. I knew not of her presence
until I heard her singing a plaintive melody, and
before it ended, she met my impassioned gaze. I saw
the thrill of agony that shook her frame, and when she
left the room, I followed; for the sight of her suffering
maddened me. Then were wild words spoken—words
which left lightning traces on more than one
heart and brain. There were tears which seared as
they fell—there was one long kiss, when our two souls
rushed into one, and fell back, crushed and bleeding,
from that fearful embrace. There was one wild, despairing
farewell, and we were parted forever. The
next morning I left England, and for months wandered
over the Continent like a spirit of unrest, till at length
wearied and sick with that heart-sickness which no
art can cure, I returned home to die. Ella was absent
when I reached my home. I remember being seized
with a sudden fainting as I entered the room, and then
all is a vague dream, till I awoke one morning as from
sleep, and found myself weak as an infant. Then,
as I slowly recovered, I first became aware of the
exceeding strength of woman’s love. My wife, who,
like an angel of mercy, had watched over my sick bed,
whose gentle and patient tenderness had endured all
things without a complaining word; oh, my father,
spare me the recital of what followed—she knew all—she
left me, that I might once more be free; she hoped
I might be happy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a long time he was silent, and when he spoke
again, his voice was feeble and broken, and he wiped
the large drops from his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There is but one scene more. I sat alone in my
deserted house, and prayed to die, for my grief was
too heavy to be borne. Suddenly a carriage drove to
the door, and a letter was handed me. It contained
but few words, but those few I can never forget.
‘The time is come when without guilt thou mayest
look upon me. The love which men give the dead,
even the living may forgive. Now, when <a id='pass'></a>passed away
from thee forever—now only may I say—<span class='it'>I love thee!</span>’ ’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I descended to the carriage, and they drove me
to the door of a large mansion, where I was met by
General St. Clair. His face was sad but stern, as he
seized my arm, and simply saying it had been the last
request of Leonore, he led me to a darkened room, and
left me. On a couch near the window lay a form
covered with a heavy pall. I raised it, and saw
Leonore reclining there in the perfect beauty of repose.
I knelt beside her, and pressing her cold hand to my
aching heart, spoke her name. But the dark lashes
moved not on her cheek—never more might those
glorious eyes flash forth their welcome at my coming—never
more would those pale lips open with words
of greeting. She was dead, and the guilt of a double
murder lay upon my soul.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again <a id='there'></a>there was a deep silence, and I heard the
slow, labored breathing of the dying man. The priest
bent over him, saying ‘Son, there is mercy for the
guiltiest—despair not.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I do not despair,’ replied he, fervently speaking
with effort. ‘The time for that passed away with the
hour when calmed and humbled I knelt at the altar of
my God, whose dealings with me even then I understood
not, and consecrated my life to his service.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Thine hour is come. Son, art thou ready to depart?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There was one hope,’ he replied, faintly, ‘one
last hope that my fatal life might end in peace. But
God hath ordered otherwise, and it is well.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What was that hope?’ asked the priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I heard not long since that Ella was not dead.
That she escaped to this new world. I hoped to find
her, and solace her for years of suffering by my deep
devotion. Oh, my God!’ he added, suddenly clasping
his hands together, ‘why couldst thou not grant this
last prayer of a broken heart. To see her, to hear her
say that I am forgiven—to die upon her breast⁠—’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could restrain myself no longer, and rushed forward,
exclaiming, ‘Gerald, my love, my husband!
behold me here, loving thee, forgiving thee, even as
when for thy sake, I left thy country and thy home!’
I sunk, half kneeling, on the floor beside the bed. He
gazed on me a moment in speechless wonder, and then,
with the supernatural strength of life’s last effort, lifted
himself from the pillows, and clasping his arms around
me, drew me close, close to his heart. Oh, the blissful
repose, the unmingled ecstasy of that moment. Forgotten
were my wrongs and my sorrow—the agony
behind, and the desolation before—the coming and the
bygone despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Closer and closer grew his embrace, and his face
touched mine. ‘My wife, my bride—receive the last
kiss of him who is now wholly thine!’ I raised my
head, and his cold lips pressed mine. I felt his form
sink slowly beneath me, and the clinging arms relax
their hold. I knew that the spirit had fled, and thanked
God for that one hour of bliss which left me alone
again on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
Here the manuscript ceased suddenly, and though
some words had been added, apparently at a later date,
the hand of the writer must have been weak indeed,

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Edwards Perley was not a man of wealth,
although, at different periods of his life, he had been
the owner of property valued at from one hundred
thousand dollars to half a million. But this property
being either in Texas land scrip, South Carolina gold
mines, Western town lots, Mulberry trees, Maine
wild lands, or other people’s promises to pay, Mr.
Perley had never been able to realize what was so
nearly a splendid fortune within his grasp. The revolution
in Texas destroyed the value of Mexican grants,
in which he had become largely interested, and the
sale of square leagues of the “best cotton land in the
world,” not only ceased suddenly, but the bills received
for previous sales came back upon him dishonored.
This was a sad damper on the golden hopes
of the enthusiastic Mr. Edwards Perley. For a couple
of years he had been selling land scrip from Bangor
to New Orleans; and had been out on the Red River
twice, during the time, with a surveying company,
whose business it was to locate the little league-square
lots. On these expeditions, he had become rather intimately
acquainted with alligators and ague, and, on
his return, deemed it no more than prudent to keep
himself quiet until he regained his complexion, and the
healthy roundness of his limbs and features. Mr.
Perley worked hard in this matter; but it suited his
temperament. He was no plodding genius, content to
count sixpences first, then shillings, and so on until
dollars began to appear. Not he. In that slow way
to wealth he could not walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as Mr. Perley, who valued his property at hundreds
of thousands of dollars in the present, and looked
upon it as possessing an annually duplicating quality—just
as Mr. Perley had selected a beautiful site for
building a palace in New York, and had decided upon
the plans submitted by a distinguished architect, the
troubles in Texas destroyed the value of his scrip, and
down he went to ruin like a collapsed balloon; and
dozens of his confiding friends went with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Edwards Perley had too much native buoyancy
of character, too much hope in life, to be put
down by ill-natured fortune after this summary manner.
In the wreck and ruin in which he was involved,
he managed to get hold of a plank on which to float
ashore. With a few hundred dollars, which he had
contrived to save, under a self-enacted “homestead
exemption” law, he opened an exchange office in Wall
street, on a very small scale. Though his business
operations scarcely reached, for a time, the aggregate
of hundreds per day, there were not a few of his
acquaintances who believed his transactions to be
limited only by thousands; and they were indebted to
him for their ideas on the subject. Give a man the
reputation of doing a large business, and business will
be sure to come. So it was in the case of Edwards
Perley. Talking and boasting were of great use to
him. In a few years he was getting along, as the saying
is, “swimmingly.” But, like the man who, after
creeping along for a week in a stage-coach, grows impatient
if the cars do not make thirty miles an hour
instead of twenty, Mr. Perley, as soon as affairs became
prosperous with him again, grew dissatisfied
with what appeared a slow accumulation, and began
to look around him for some good speculation. He
was not long in finding what he sought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is not our purpose to follow Mr. Perley
through the various stages of his Carolina gold and
Morus Multicaulis fevers; nor to minutely detail his
operations in Western lands and town lots. As it had
been in Texas land scrip, so it proved in all these.
The visionary speculator, who sought wealth for its
own sake, and was too eager for its possession to be
willing to give back to society an equivalent of useful
acts, after running a wild course for a few years,
again tripped and fell. This time he found it much
more difficult to recover himself. But with an elasticity
of feeling that few possess, he went hopefully to
work, and by dint of magnifying his own peculiar
abilities, and his knowledge of business, induced a
shrewd, calculating Yankee, who had a few thousand
dollars, to join him in business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a year or two, Perley was content to move on
slowly. After that, he grew ambitious and restless
again. The fire had not burned out; it was only
covered for a while. Of Jenkins, his partner, he had
no very high opinion. He considered him a mere
plodding genius, whose mind was in no way suggestive.
He would do for a well beaten track, but for
enterprise he was nobody. So he thought. But Jenkins
had rather more shrewdness than his partner gave
him credit for. He belonged to the class of men who
think a great deal before they act, and who, therefore,
rarely make mistakes in business matters. He understood
Perley “like a book,” and was, therefore, prepared
to counteract, judiciously, all his efforts that
were not wisely directed. Reactions of this kind becoming,
as business grew into importance, more and
more frequent, Mr. Perley felt restless under them,
and often lamented that affairs were not entirely under
his own control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the aspect of things when the golden news
from California startled the most sober-minded with its
tale of wonder. Perley believed every word of the
first account, while Jenkins coolly took the liberty of
doubting the whole story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s preposterous,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look at the official nature of the intelligence,”
urged Perley.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
“Officials can lie as well as other people. It’s all
a speculation to get settlers out there. Don’t tell me
of gold scattered about as thick as jack-stones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perley maintained the other side of the question, and
soon had the satisfaction of pushing most abundant
confirmations into the face of his partner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Jenkins, “what of it? Suppose there
is gold there? It doesn’t make me any better off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it will make you better off, if you seize the advantage
now offered to every energetic and truly enterprising
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jenkins opened his eyes rather wider than usual;
then shrugging his shoulders, he answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My business creed is—‘Let well enough alone.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And mine,” replied Perley, “is to seize upon every
advantage that offers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point the conversation was interrupted, and
as neither party, for good reasons, thought it advisable
to renew it, the subject did not come up between them
for several days. During this time Perley could think
of little else but California, and the golden harvest it presented;
and the more he thought of it, the more fully
satisfied was he that an immense fortune might speedily
be realized by trading in that region. What was in the
way, when blankets sold for ten dollars each, a pair of
boots for double that sum, flour for sixty dollars a barrel,
and every thing else in proportion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fact is, Jenkins,” said he, renewing the subject
not many days after the first conversation, “we
must make some of this hay while the sun is shining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The golden hay, you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are we to make it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By going sickle in hand to the field, and reaping
with the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose the field should be reaped before we get
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That cannot be. The gold region is a thousand
miles in length and several hundreds in breadth. There
is enough for all who will go for the next ten years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must beg leave to doubt that,” coolly replied
Jenkins. “It’s all a feverish imagination. Gold dazzles
the eyes and keeps men from seeing in a clear
light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear man,” said Perley, “look at the facts
and judge for yourself. Take Governor Mason’s statement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Suppose we believe all the governor
says, what then? Why, the man who finds an ounce
of gold a day has to pay about sixteen prices for the necessaries
of life, and, so is no better off than the man
here who earns a dollar in the same time. The only
way in which he can accumulate gold is to live like a
savage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, I wouldn’t go to <span class='it'>dig</span> gold!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go! Surely you do not think seriously of going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry to hear you say that, Mr. Perley. We
are doing exceedingly well and our business is growing.
Last year it doubled, and is in a fair way of doubling
itself again this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is such a rate of increase to the golden
gains that are now offered? Nothing—nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Jenkins could not talk as fluently as his partner,
and was in this instance, as he had been once or twice
before, silenced but not convinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daily there came some fresh intelligence touching
the gold deposits in our new possessions, and the note
of preparation for a speedy flight was sounded in all
directions. The newspapers teemed with exciting statements,
and every man you met in the street, on ’change,
or in the social circle, had something to say about
California. Daily the fever increased, and particularly
with Mr. Edwards Perley, until he began to be slightly
delirious. But, though the epidemic raged all around
him, Mr. Jenkins remained calm and cool. If any one
talked to him about California, he shook his head with
an emphasis that left no doubt as to the state of his
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My California is here,” he sometimes replied.
“Wait for ten years, and see then who is best off. If
gold is so abundant as they say it is, and obtained so
easily, I shall benefit as well as those who dig for it.
‘Come easy, go easy,’ you know. The man who
picks up a pound of gold wont value it as much as he
who earns it by the sweat of his brow, and will part
with it far more easily. So, after all, the gold will flow
from the hands of those who gather it freely, through
all the channels of trade, and we who continue in the
pursuit of useful employments, will be likely to reap
the most abundant harvest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this,” Perley said, “was little better than nonsense.
‘Give me a bird in the hand, and you may have
two in the bush.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just my own sentiment,” returned Jenkins. “I have
the bird in the hand here, I can’t let it go for two in
the bush away out on the Pacific.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the fever went on increasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Jenkins,” said Perley, as he was about leaving
the store one afternoon, “I wish you would drop
down to my house this evening, I want to have some
talk with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” replied the partner. So about eight
o’clock he called down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see you in order to have a more serious
talk about California,” said Perley. “I am satisfied
that the subject has not had in your mind the consideration
it demands, and that if you saw it as I do, you
would not be so insensible to the extraordinary advantages
that are now offered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jenkins felt in no mood for argument or controversy,
though his mind was as clear as a bell, and his purpose
as immovable as ever. So he bent his head in a listening
attitude, and looked up from under his drooping
eyelashes, willing to listen, but firmly resolved not to be
started from the rock upon which he had fixed himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first proposition made by Perley, after eloquently
setting forth the advantage of turning all their capital
and energy into this new field, was to charter a vessel,
put their whole stock of goods on board, and take a
flight to San Francisco. But the wonderful profit to be
made did not in the least tempt his phlegmatic, long-headed
partner, who was beginning to calculate the
amount of advantage he might gain in the approaching
dissolution of co-partnership—for to that he saw it
would come.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
“You will not go,” said Perley, on receiving a positive
negative to this proposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not for twice the inducement. I am not going
to risk my life, nor abridge my comfort, in a wild
enterprise like this, when I am doing well at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perley leaned back, looked to the ceiling, and mused
for some moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” said he, “if you are unwilling to
assume so great a risk, let me go out with an adventure,
and you remain at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jenkins was growing wider awake every moment.
Having once entertained the idea of getting
rid of his partner, and coming into the undivided advantage
of his business, he had no notion of agreeing
to any thing short of that. So he affirmed, in his quiet
way, that he would have nothing to do with the gold
bubble in any form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we must dissolve,” said Perley, half fretfully.
He was restive under the check-rein of his
cool-tempered partner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you like about that,” was imperturbably answered.
It would have taken an eye well skilled in
the signs of human emotions to have detected, in the
immovable face of the calculating Yankee, the smallest
indication of pleasure. Yet his pleasure was great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proposition thus made and agreed to, was forthwith
carried out. As Perley was determined upon a
dissolution at all hazards, and, as his partner affected
entire indifference, the odds were altogether against
him, and he was compelled to accept of any arrangement
that suited the other. So excited was he about
California, and so eager to get off, that he accepted, as
his half of the business, a portion of old, and, to a
great extent, unsaleable stock, and shipped it by the
first vessel that sailed for Monterey and San Francisco.
Its real value in the New York market was
about five thousand dollars; its estimated value in the
settlement ten thousand, and its prospective value as
an adventure at the gold diggings fifty thousand.
Above this, three thousand dollars in cash were paid
to Mr. Perley. Two thousand were left for the support
of his family, and one thousand he took with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks after the vessel in which he had shipped
his goods sailed, the impatient Mr. Perley, who
neither thought nor dreamed of any thing else but gold,
and who already saw himself surrounded with heaps
of the precious lumps and scales from Feather River,
left New York in a steamer for Chagres. As to what
Chagres was really like, and as to the real nature of
the journey across the Isthmus, Mr. Perley had no
correct notion. He had thought of a town with comfortable
accommodations, and when those around him
talked of canoes and mules as the means of transportation
to Panama, something elegant, like a Venetian
gondola, or a richly caparisoned animal, was present
to his imagination. A few mud huts, with their naked
inhabitants, was all he found, upon being disgorged,
with some two hundred others, in the rain, to join a
congregation of nearly a hundred others, who had arrived
on the day before, and who were awaiting the
return of canoes from Cruces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Perley, like most men of his class, never gave
as much attention to little things as prudence required.
The man who couldn’t waste time and precious
thought on so insignificant an article as a linchpin,
was about as wise as Mr. Perley in many of the affairs
of life. His friends had nearly all asked him in regard
to his outfit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that is all right!” or, “I’ve taken good care
of that,” he would unhesitatingly answer. Yet, on
reaching Chagres, he had neither tea, coffee, sugar,
bread nor meat in his possession. He had money, and
this he knew to be all powerful in procuring supplies
of any kind; at least, such had been his experience in
life. But he was about coming into some new experiences.
Neither food nor lodgings were to be had
from the natives at Chagres, for “love or money.”
Such a sudden influx of Yankee gold diggers was a
thing altogether unanticipated and unprovided for, and
those who came had, therefore, to provide for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week was spent at Chagres before Mr. Perley
was lucky enough to procure passage up the river in a
canoe, with one of the five trunks of merchandise he
had brought with him in the steamer—the remaining
four were left behind, with instructions to have them
sent over to Panama as quickly as possible. He never
saw or heard of them afterward! During this week
the poor man nearly starved, for all he could get to eat
was an occasional hard biscuit from some fellow passenger.
It rained nearly the whole time, and night
and day he was in the open air. Wet to the skin,
when affirmed of Mr. Perley, was about as literally
true as ever the saying was or will be. In this plight,
with a fever of rather a more serious character than
the gold fever, our adventurer embarked in a canoe,
for the privilege of sitting in one end of which, or lying
flat on the bottom, for three or four days, he paid the
moderate price of fifty dollars, and then thought himself
lucky. For a hundred dollars more he was to
share the scanty food of his traveling companion, who,
wiser than he, had more accurately counted the cost,
and prepared himself for the contingencies of the
journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day after leaving Chagres, the sun came out
from beneath a veil of clouds, and poured its hot rays
upon the head of Mr. Perley. Under this he wilted
down like a leaf before the fire. On the second day
he was so ill that he could not hold up his head;
and by the time he reached Cruces, instead of being
in a condition to take his place on a mule’s back, he
was utterly prostrate in body, and delirious with fever.
Seeing this, and considering him as good as dead, his
companion, after possessing himself of his money and
trunk, gave the natives who had brought them up
twenty dollars to take him back to Chagres in their
canoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When distinctly conscious once more, Mr. Perley
found himself on shipboard, with the rush of waters
around him. He was as weak as an infant in body,
and almost as weak as an infant in mind. Ideas came
confusedly, and faded ere he was able to separate the
tangled mass. In a few days he was enough recovered
to connect his thoughts, and to call up events to the
period of his embarking from Chagres. Beyond that,
his memory did not serve him. He soon after became
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
apprized of the fact that he was on his way to New
York, and might expect to be there in less than a
week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On arriving at home, Mr. Perley was as one who
had risen from the grave. News of his illness, with
a prophecy of his certain death, had reached New
York by a previous arrival. Slowly recovered the
disappointed man, and as health came flowing once
more along his veins, his thoughts were again turned
toward El Dorado, whither he had sent an adventure,
and from which, he yet hoped to realize a splendid
fortune. Of his five trunks and the money he had
taken with him no traces remained. Even he had
some pretty well grounded doubts of ever seeing them
again; and in this matter his doubts only foreshadowed
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A month after Mr. Perley’s return to New York, he
was preparing to start again, although thousands and
thousands had gone before, and were choking up all
the avenues of communication to the Pacific and along
the coast. His friends urged him not to risk his life
again; but his goods were on the way to San Francisco,
and here was his only chance to realize a fortune.
So he got himself ready for another flight. But
just as he was on the point of starting, the vessel in
which he had shipped his goods returned to port, so
much damaged by a storm as to be unfit to weather
the Cape. When she put to sea she was scarcely
equal to the voyage, and insurance could only be
effected at very high rates. A heavy leak had damaged,
more or less, a great portion of the cargo,
among which were the goods of Mr. Perley. This
damage, so far as Mr. Perley was concerned, was
assessed at one thousand dollars, and paid. The balance
of his goods were sold off at auction, in a spirit
of recklessness engendered by a temporary despondency,
for two thousand dollars more. And thus ended
Mr. Perley’s California expedition!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Disappointed, disheartened and almost beside himself,
the unfortunate man wandered about the city in a
state of irresolution for a month or two; while his old
partner, the cool, shrewd Yankee, was rejoicing over
the fine business which had come exclusively into his
hands, and saying to himself—“It’s an ill wind that
blows nobody any good.” At last Mr. Perley’s organ
of Hope became again active; and, as intelligence
from the gold region came with so many drawbacks,
he concluded to try his fortune once more at home,
and so, with the three thousand dollars that remained,
started his old exchange business in Wall street, where
he may now be seen counting his uncurrent money,
and sighing over the smallness of his gains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although a stricken bachelor, I cannot speak without
emotion of my first love. An eastern philosopher
says—it is with first love as with a first cigar; one
precipitates himself upon it, luxuriates to the utmost in
the draught, and when it is over, is sensible of a melancholy
unlike that induced by any other loss. I suppose
I may consider myself particularly fortunate,
having felt no reaction after my first cigar, and finding
equally harmless consequences from my first love. I
do not mean to say that I was so happy as to find the
passion returned; ah, no! for then—I should have been
a Benedict. I mean that I imbibed all of bliss which
belongs to the feeling, without hazarding the loss of my
peace; I enjoyed it while it was permitted to last, with
but a few trifling drawbacks, and that without stirring
a fountain of remorse or regret to sprinkle with bitterness
my future years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the winter of 18— I chanced to lodge in ——
Place, in the establishment then kept by Mrs. ——.
My apartment was on the third floor, and overlooked
the street; the room immediately back of it, which I
used for my books and papers, looked into a small court,
and commanded a view through the windows opposite,
of the parlor on the second floor in the rear, which was
occupied by the young lady to whom my attention was
devoted. She and her mother had been inmates of the
house but a short time, when the sight of her, seated
at her embroidery-frame near the window, took my
heart captive at once. She had long, fair ringlets, that
seemed touched with gold when the light fell on them;
her complexion was beautifully fair, with a rose-like
tint in her cheeks; the bright line of her lips disclosed
pearly teeth, and she had the finest turned neck and
shoulders nature ever fashioned to put art to shame.
But her hand—that small, white, dimpled hand, which
she often held up in my view, while selecting a shade
of worsted, threading her needle, counting the stitches,
or practicing any of the little coquetries of her work!
No sculptor could have rivaled the perfection of that
hand. Those taper fingers drew the string which sped
Cupid’s arrow to my heart. I often tried to draw that
hand, and as often gave up the task in despair, for it
never was still long enough. Sometimes I saw it
wandering over the strings of her guitar; for almost
always, of an evening, she played and <a id='sang2'></a>sang, and then,
after having watched her tuning it, how I hated the
envious curtains that were so closely drawn to shut out
paradise from my longing eyes. For hours I would stand
at my window, having no other occupation than feeding
the pigeons that gathered about the frame, observing
her by stealth as she worked or watered the
flowers that lived under her care, or petted a delicate
canary-bird, whose cage hung on the wall outside. I
had no pleasure so great as that of gazing upon her;
yet I could plainly see that my devotion was unmarked,
for she was near-sighted, and could not, at even a short
distance, perceive that she was so earnestly regarded.
To that circumstance, in all probability, I owed the
liberty I enjoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I always retreated from the window when her
mother approached, for she had eyes that rivaled those
of a lynx. She was tall, moreover, with black eyes
and hair; rather robust in person, and with an unmistakable
air of hauteur, which proved quite as effectual
as she could have wished in keeping people at a
distance. Her voice was naturally harsh and imperious,
though usually subdued in its tones, except on
occasions when sudden irritation caused the speaker to
forget her dignity. Even in her gentlest moods it had
a latent sharpness that twanged uneasily on my ears,
especially when I remembered how necessary it was
to secure the favor of this haughty lady, in order to
advance a step toward the accomplishment of my hopes
with the lovely daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, then, stood the case; I was desperately, irremediably
in love with this young girl; ready for any
venture to win her, but uncertain how to commence
an acquaintance, for I was not even among the privileged
number of her visiters. We lodged under the
same roof; we sat at the same table, though at different
ends of it; but I knew no one of whom I could ask an
introduction to her; and I felt, alas! that my position
in life did not quite entitle me to enter the list of her
suitors without such formalities as might smooth over
a surprise. I was a painter; rising in my profession,
it is true, and numbering many friends, but as yet,
having fortune only in prospect. Mrs. Elwyn, for that
was the name of the mother of my charmer, was independent,
though not rich; and having in early life
moved much in fashionable society, and been much
admired, was very proud, and would scarcely have
owned among her acquaintances one who depended
on the labor of hands or head for a maintenance.
Neither she nor her daughter ever entered the common
drawing-room; and those of the lodgers who knew her
slightly, spoke of her as distant and unsocial, except
to the favored few whom she thought worth cultivating,
on account of their possession of worldly advantages.
She was precisely the sort of woman on whom I would
never have wasted an act of courtesy, had she been
the mother of any other daughter. But in the fair
Gertrude there was such a bewitching unconsciousness
of her own superiority, such an appealing eloquence
in silence, to the sympathy of those around her—such
an air of child-like humility, mingled with just
enough of the graceful pride of woman, as completed
the fascination her beauty had begun, and inspired one
with a wish to please even her repulsive parent. I saw
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
her not only at meals, but occasionally out of the house,
at concerts or the Opera. To me she was the soul of
the music, and the finest symphony of Beethoven would
have been lifeless without her. At church I met her now
and then, and sometimes walking; but Mrs. Elwyn
never vouchsafed me the most distant bow of recognition.
She seemed by intuition to guess my bold
wishes and frown upon them. Gertrude was always
modestly looking down; but at intervals the fringe of
her blue eyes would be suddenly lifted, disclosing a
world of witchery beneath, to be quickly veiled again,
as if she knew she was transgressing. It was the evidence
of this consciousness on her part that fanned my
love continually into a brighter flame, and caused me
to revolve various expedients to secure to myself the
enjoyment of her society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought of painting her picture as she sat embroidering
at the window, and sending it as a present to
the mother; but I lacked as yet, sufficient confidence
in my talent for the art, in which I was but a student,
and the terror of her condemnation, both of the artist
and the lover, was too formidable to be encountered.
A dread of her cold penetration prevented me also from
putting in execution a cherished project; that of offering
my services to teach the beautiful Gertrude Italian,
which I knew she wished to acquire. The very day
I had mustered up courage to resolve on the experiment,
I heard that Mrs. Elwyn had hired a teacher—a
dark-visaged, whiskered fellow, whom, from that
moment, I wished in the dungeons of Spielberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was there ever a more hopeless case of love; yet
I was not unhappy, for I had the privilege of seeing
her, unawed by fear of interruption; and my passion
was not yet so encrusted with selfishness that it demanded
more. I lived in the present, and hope colored
the future with rosy light; even the feeling of disappointment
was but momentary. I almost dreaded a
change, though I knew this could not satisfy me long,
and that a wilder, more impetuous, and less amiable
stage was to follow. Already the first sweet, sparkling
foam of the cup had been quaffed; beneath was
that which bewilders the brain and steals away the
senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been reading one night till past midnight—for
strangely enough, I had a taste for novels after the
beginning of the romance of my life—when my attention
was arrested by hearing a carriage stop in the
street before the door. Presently the bell rang, not
very gently. A short pause, and it was again rung;
while I was conscious of a twinge of sympathy for the
late comer; for the night was piercing cold, and the
wind came in hoarse blasts, rattling the window-panes,
and sending a chill through the bones. The contrast
offered by my snug apartment, with its crimson curtains
and chintz-covered sofa, and the dying glow of
the embers thrown on the Venetian rug, was peculiarly
suggestive of ideas of comfort. I thought how
hard it must be for the porter to be summoned out of
his warm bed in the little chamber at the back of the
court, and judged the applicant for admission at such
an hour justly punished by delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, and again, and yet again sounded the bell,
each time with a more prolonged and angry pull, as if
the person at the door, with patience exhausted, was
resolved to take the house by storm. A thought darted
like lightning through my brain. I had seen Miss
Elwyn that evening, in full dress, passing with her
mother through the hall. They had gone to a party—they
had returned late. I sprung to the window—threw
it open; and sure enough, though it was too
dark to distinguish any object, I heard with sufficient
distinctness the shrill, complaining tones of the mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By good luck I was still dressed, and I lost not an
instant. Snatching up the light, I hastened down two
flights of stairs, to the front door. My heart beat; my
breath came quickly; I felt as if the crisis of my life
were at hand. I should meet her face to face; I
should speak to her—should render a service that
demanded acknowledgment, and might open for me a
vista of happiness; I grasped the handle of the door,
and with trembling hands unlocked and opened it; there
was a rush of wind, and—my light was extinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sleep like a night-watcher, sir!” screamed
the angry voice of Mrs. Elwyn, as she pushed her
way in. “To keep us standing half an hour in the
cold! We might have caught our death! You deserve
to lose your place; I shall make complaint of you in
the morning, depend upon it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she spoke, the daughter’s silken mantle
brushed past me, and her gloved fingers pressed something
into my hand. I had no time to explain; I could
not have uttered a word; my breath seemed to forsake
me, and my silly bashfulness held me motionless,
as if chained to the spot. I stood there till the ladies
had ascended the first flight of stairs—the mamma
grumbling as she went—still grasping mechanically in
my hand what the fair Gertrude had placed therein.
Ere long, however, my self-possession returned; I
ascended to my room, lighted the candle, and examined
the gift. My beloved had presented me with
half a dollar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite evident that both had mistaken me for
the unlucky porter, at that time snoring in his dormitory;
and that the gentle girl had bestowed the coin
by way of consolation for her mother’s chiding. I
kissed the piece of silver which had come from her
hand, and was a token of the benevolence of her heart.
A ray of hope gleamed from its polished face. The
matter must necessarily be explained; the mistake
must be rectified. This would lead to an interview;
and I would trust fortune for the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After due deliberation, I came to the conclusion that
as the affair in some points wore a comical aspect, it
would be best to present it in that light. I took my pencil
and hammered out some poetry, which was to be sent
with the half dollar to the fair donor. Under the veil
of a sprightly and facetious effusion, I thought, more
could be said, than in a grave note; and no offence
could be taken at verses meant for a <span class='it'>jeu d’esprit</span>, describing
the feeling experienced when the coin touched
my palm, as “shocking”—which word terminated the
line—imperative necessity called for a rhyme—it ran
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Oh, had the gift been but a glove—or stocking!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Such token from <span class='it'>thy</span> hand a joy had given,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;I would not barter for the joy of heaven!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
I was not much used to writing poetry; but on reading
over the missive, it struck me as combining humor
and sentiment in a manner peculiarly felicitous. The
lines could not fail to make an impression; she would,
perhaps, reply; all would fall out as I wished, and I
should look upon that night as the most fortunate of
my life. I mended a crow-quill, and copied the verses
neatly on rose-colored paper, resolving to send them
the first thing in the morning. She would then see
they had been written impromptu. It was late when
I threw myself on the bed, and late when I awoke.
No benevolent genius warned me in the visions of
slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day I folded the money and verses together,
and dispatched the package to my charmer by the
maid. I was frequently at my post of observation;
but not once did I catch a glimpse of her at the window.
The guitar was silent—the embroidery-frame untouched.
Toward evening I waylaid the chamber-maid,
and having crossed her hand with a piece of
silver, inquired particularly how my dispatch had been
received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sir,” was the answer, “the young lady only
laughed, and showed the paper to her mother; and
Mrs. Elwyn threw it into the fire, and said as how she
wondered how you could have had the impudence;
but she expected you did not know any better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A blight fell upon my hopes; I had evidently committed
an error. That unlucky “stocking!”, it was
that which had played me false—which had offended
the lady’s sense of propriety—which had suddenly let
down a partition-wall between me and the accomplishment
of my hopes. But through the chinks of
that now impassable barrier, Gertrude appeared lovelier
than ever. A thousand wild projects floated through
my brain. I would hire bandits to assail her; would
rush in time to the rescue, and be wounded in her defense.
I would play the incendiary, and bear her in
triumph through the flames; I would get up a quarrel,
and fight a duel for her sake. But these were only
feverish fantasies—castles built in the air—which
melted in the cold current of reality. I could perceive
plainly that at table, when I stole a glance at her, Mrs.
Elwyn had grown colder and statelier than ever.
She never honored me by a look, and, worse than all,
Gertrude did not appear. It was not till after two days
I learned, by mere accident, that she had taken cold on
that eventful night, and was indisposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But ill luck cannot last always. The beautiful girl
soon reappeared at meals as blooming and radiant as
usual; and, oh joy! again I was so happy as to behold
her seated at the window, and watch the movements
of her delicate fingers over the strings of her guitar.
Here was a bliss of which no frowning matron could
deprive me. One day, too, as in my eagerness to
drink in the tones of her music, I had softly opened my
window, and was imprudently leaning forward, rapt
in a trance of bliss, I saw an unmistakable smile on
her lips. Yes, she smiled; and though at the same
moment she drew back, and let the guitar slide from
her lap, my heart was thrilled by the knowledge that
she was at last aware of my secret. What woman
could be insensible to homage so delicate and unobtrusive.
Hope once more stirred within me. The
next morning I bribed the maid to leave on her table,
as if by mistake, a just published number of the “Home
Journal,” in which was a poem of rare beauty, which
aptly expressed my admiration and my love. I had
ventured to draw a light pencil line around the verses,
which I hoped she might perceive and understand.
My little ruse succeeded. A servant brought me the
paper in the evening, saying it had been left by mistake
in Mrs. Elwyn’s apartment; but it bore evidence
of having been carefully read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not safe to venture often on such expedients;
but the fourteenth of February was at hand; and the
most timid lover might avail himself of its privileges.
Valentines of all descriptions, for all stages of the
tender passion, were to be had at the fancy stores; and
a little alteration made them original. On the morning
of the festival, one, delicately painted on embossed
paper, and glowing with sentiment, was dispatched to
the fair Gertrude, and was followed by one for each
day of the week succeeding. I received none in return—but
I was not discouraged; it was enough that
mine were read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was now at the height of my content; for there
was a charm in the sort of mystery that enveloped our
intercourse, the more delightful to me, because I had
the authority of all the romances I had ever read, for
believing that it was the best nourisher of affection.
Fancy would invest with a thousand gifts and graces,
the lover whom she knew not, yet whose devotion
was breathed into the air around her. Flowers would
succeed verses as the messengers of the heart; I should
grow bolder in time, till every obstacle was triumphed
over. Such would have been the natural course of
things but for the awkward interruption which brings
me to the conclusion of my story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had gone one evening to a supper given by a
bachelor friend, and returned late from the scene of
mirth and revelry. As I walked rapidly down ——
Place, for the night was chilly, and the street covered
with snow, I saw two ladies alight from a carriage in
front of Mrs. ——’s house. I hastened my pace; a
thrill of joy penetrated my breast; it was she—my beloved,
with her mother; and both were, by a happy
chance, destined to be obliged to me. I sprung up the
steps, murmured a “good evening,” and drew out my
night-key. I was surprised to find how much courage,
nay, even pride, I derived from the possession of this
little instrument. Briefly apologizing to the ladies for
thus venturing to save them the trouble of summoning
a servant, I thrust the key in the lock, and turned it with
all my force. It snapped violently; I drew out the
fragment, and, to my horror, discovered that in my
haste, I had not used the night-key, but the key of my
chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really—beg ten thousand pardons,” I faltered—“it
was the wrong key⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The key is broken!” cried the shrill voice of Mrs.
Elwyn. “It is dreadful to be kept standing here!” She
pulled the bell furiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In affright I pulled it also; the porter’s hurried steps
were presently heard in the hall, and he was rattling at
the lock.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>
“Open the door!” cried the lady, impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot unlock it!” said the man within; “there
must be something in the key-hole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The broken key!” screamed Mrs. Elwyn, with an
angry glance at me; “so officious, to insist—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother!” pleaded the soft, low voice of Gertrude;
for she saw that the dame was forgetting herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must—it can—I will run for a locksmith!” I
exclaimed. I saw that the carriage had driven off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we are to stand here alone, perhaps to be insulted
by any drunken vagabond!” cried Mrs. Elwyn.
“But go—nothing else can be done. Make haste—why
do you wait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A locksmith lived in the next street; I flew thither;
by chance he was still up, and as soon as his tools
could be collected, he hastened to the spot. There
stood the angry lady, her teeth chattering with cold,
her mantle covered with the snow-flakes that had
begun to fall, murmuring at the delay; her daughter
was leaning in silence against the side of the door; and
within could be heard the grumbling of the porter. I
could not see Gertrude’s face, even if I had been calm
enough to read its expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The skillful locksmith, with the ready tact of his
profession, soon comprehended the difficulty, and
having tried to pick the lock, decided that it must be
done from the inside. A ladder was in requisition, to
enter by the window above. Mrs. Elwyn was in despair
at this intelligence, and broke out into complaints
and reproaches, intended for me, which I heard but
imperfectly, as I ran to borrow a ladder of some firemen
in the neighborhood. It was brought by two
of the company, who were followed by several others
eager to learn what was going on. These were joined
by some late idlers, while the windows of the adjoining
and opposite houses, as well as those of our own, were
thrown open, and a multitude of heads thrust out to
see what was the matter. A pretty scene for the
crowd-hating, aristocratic, haughty Mrs. Elwyn! For
once, unmindful of her dignity, she stood giving voluble
directions to the locksmith, already at the window,
calling to him with flurried emphasis, to be careful not
to throw down the flower-stand, or break the vase full
of goldfish—which articles belonged to her. As for
me, my only feeling was one of absolute despair, for I
knew that my transgression, with its consequences,
was unpardonable. We obtained entrance at last, and
I heard the farewell of my love in the indignant rustle
of Mrs. Elwyn’s mantle, as she swept up stairs. A
day or two after she and her daughter departed on a
visit to Washington, and when they returned, took
lodgings elsewhere. I heard in a few months of Gertrude’s
marriage, but felt no sorrow, for the spell was
broken. That midnight scene, with the mortification
it caused me, was a harmless termination to my First
Love.</p>

<p class='dramaline'>That, woven in fruit-like clusters, hung above,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Starring the raven curtains of her hair⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Declared such calm of happiness, as never</p>

<p class='dramaline'>Deformed the beautiful picture of repose,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or spoke th’ unequal struggle, when fond life</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Strives with its dread antipathy. Her limbs</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lay pliant, with composure, on the couch,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Whose draperies loosely fell about her form,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With gentle flow, and natural fold on fold,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Proof of no difficult conflict. There had been,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Perchance, one pang of terror, when she gave</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Free access to her terrible enemy;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Or in the moment when the venomous chill</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Went sudden to her heart; for from her neck</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The silken robes had parted. The white breast</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Lay half revealed, save where the affluent hair</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Streamed over it in thick disheveled folds,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That asked no further care. Oh! to behold,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With eye still piercing to the sweet recess,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where rose each gentle slope, that seemed to swell</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beneath mine eye, as conscious of my gaze,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And throbbing with emotion soft as strange,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of love akin to fear. Thus dwelling still,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Like little billows on some happy sea,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>They sudden seemed to freeze, as if the life</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Grew cold when all was loveliest. One blue vein</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Skirted the white curl of each heaving wave,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A tint from some sweet sunbow, such as life</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Flings ever on the cold domain of death;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And, at their equal heights, two ruby crests⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Two yet unopened buds from the same flower⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Borne upward by the billows, rising yet,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Grew into petrified gems, with each an eye</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Eloquent pleading to the passionate heart</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For all of love it knows! Alas! the mock!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>That Death should mask himself with loveliness,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And Beauty have no voice, in such an hour,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To warn its eager worshiper. I saw⁠—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And straight forgot, in joy of what I saw,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>What still I knew—that Death was in my sight,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And what was seeming beautiful, was but</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The twilight—the brief interval—betwixt</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The glorious day and darkness. I had kissed</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The wooing bliss before me, but that then</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Crawled forth the venomous reptile from the folds</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where still it harbored—crawled across that shrine</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of Beauty’s best perfections, which, meseemed,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To shrink and shudder ’neath its loathly march,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Instinct with all the horrors at my heart.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY G. COPWAY, OR KAH-GE-GA-GAH-BOWH.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>There lived among the hills of the North two most
intimate friends, who appeared to have loved each
other from the hour of their earliest childhood. In
summer they lived by a beautiful lake, in autumn on
the banks of a noble river. In appearance they were
nearly similar, apparently of the same age as they
were of the same size. In their early days a good old
Indian woman attended to their wants, and cared for
their wigwam. Together they strolled among the green
woods and shared the results of their ramblings. Years
passed by, and manhood came. They used larger
bows and arrows. One day the old lady took them
by her side and said—“The nation to which we belong
fasts, and now I want you to fast, that you may
become great hunters.” So they fasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As spring advanced they killed a great many wild
ducks, and kept the old woman of the wigwam busy.
In the latter part of the year they killed large numbers
of beavers, with the furs of which they clothed their
grandmother and themselves. In their journey one
day they made an agreement, to the effect, that if
when they fasted the gods were kindly disposed toward
one, he would inform the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fall they were far from the rivers, but yet
moved toward the north, where, as they knew, the
bears most resorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During that winter they killed a great many, as also
during the month of March ensuing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of one of their hunting expeditions, they
turned their feet toward their home, at which they
arrived at a late hour. As they approached, they
heard the sound of several voices besides that of their
grandmother. They listened. They knew that strangers
were in the wigwam, and entering beheld two
young and beautiful damsels, seated in that part of the
room in which they generally rested during the night.
To the young hunters the young women appeared
very strange and modest. At length the old lady said
to the young men⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nosesetook—my children—I have called these
two young women from the south, that they may aid
me in taking care of all the meat and venison you
bring home, for I am getting old and weak, and cannot
do as much as I used to. I have put them by your
sides that they may be your companions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the last words were spoken they looked upon
each other, and soon left to wander by themselves in
the forest around. They consulted together as to
whether they should comply with her request. One
said he should leave the wigwam. The other said
that if they left there would be no one to supply their
aged grandmother. And they finally agreed to remain
in the wigwam and pay no regard to the new-comers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They slept side by side every night, and agreed that
if either should begin to love one of the young strangers
they would inform the other, and would then separate
forever. In February they obtained a vast amount of
game, as the bears having retired to their winter-quarters
were easily found and captured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was observed one evening that one of the young
men gazed very intently at one of the strangers, and
the next morning as they went out he asked the other
whether he did not begin to love the young damsel
who sat on his side of the birchen fire. He replied
negatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was observed that one of the cousins appeared to
be deeply absorbed in thought every evening, and that
his manners were very reserved. After a fortunate
hunting-day, as they were wending their way home
with their heavy burden of bear and deer, one accused
the other of loving the young woman. Tell me, said
he, and if you do, I will leave you to yourselves. If
you have a wife I cannot take the same delight with
you as I did when we followed the chase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His cousin sighed and said, “I will tell you to-night
as we lie side by side.” At night they reasoned together
and agreed to hunt. If they did not meet with
success, they must separate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning they went to the woods. They
were not far distant from each other. The one who
was in love shot only five, while the other returned
with the tongues of twenty bears. The former was
all the time thinking of the damsel at home, while the
latter sought out his game with nothing else to divert
his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On their return home the lucky man informed his
grandmother that he should leave the next day, and
that what he should kill on the morrow must be
searched after, as he should not return to tell them
where he had killed the game. His cousin was grieved
to find that his mind was made up to leave, and began
to expostulate with him to change his determination,
but he would not be persuaded to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, the young man who was to leave
bound a rabbit-skin about his neck, to keep it warm,
and having painted himself with red and yellow paints
he left; his cousin following just behind, entreating
him not to go. “I will go,” said he, “and live in the
north, where I shall see but four persons, and when
you look that way you will see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked side by side until he began to ascend,
and as he did so, the other wept the more bitterly, and
entreated him more perseveringly not to leave him.
The cousin ascended to the skies, and is now seen in
the north, Ke-wa-din Ah-nung (North Star,) still hunting
the polar bear; while the other wept himself to

answers and mocks everywhere everybody. He lives
in craggy rocks, and his name is Bah-swa-nay (Echo.)</p>

under ambrosial bowers, awaiting the return of their

<div><h1><a id='fade'></a>UNFADING FLOWERS.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY T. S. ARTHUR.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thirty years ago, a small, barefooted boy, paused
to admire the flowers in a well cultivated garden. The
child was an orphan, and had already felt how hard
the orphan’s lot. The owner of the garden, who was
trimming a border, noticed the lad, and spoke to him
kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love flowers?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy replied, “Oh yes. We used to have beautiful
flowers in our garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man laid down his knife, and gathering a few
flowers, took them to the fence, through the <a id='pan'></a>panels of
which the boy was looking, and handing them to him,
said as he did so,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a nice little bunch for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flush went over the child’s face as he took the
flowers. He did not make any reply, but in his large
eyes, as he lifted them to the face of the man, was
an expression of thankfulness, to be read as plainly as
words in a book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The act, on the part of the man, was one of spontaneous
kindness, and scarcely thought of again; but,
by the child, it was never forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years went by, and through toil, privation and suffering,
both in body and mind, the boy grew up to
manhood. From ordeals like this, come forth our
most effective men. If kept free from vicious associates,
the lad of feeling and mental activity becomes
ambitious, and rises in society above the common level.
So it proved in the case of this orphan boy. He had
few advantages of education, but such as offered were
well improved. It happened that his lot was cast in a
printing office; and the young compositor soon became
interested in his work. He did not set the types as a
mere mechanic, but went beyond the duties of his
calling, entering into the ideas to which he was giving
verbal expression, and making them his own. At
twenty-one he was a young man of more than ordinary
intelligence and force of character. At thirty-five he
was the conductor of a widely-circulated and profitable
newspaper, and as a man, respected and esteemed
by all who knew him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the earnest struggle that all men enter into
who are ambitious to rise in the world, the thoughts
do not often go back and rest, meditatively, upon the
earlier time of life. But after success has crowned
each well-directed effort, and the gaining of a desired
position, no longer remains a subject of doubt, the mind
often brings up from the far-off past most vivid recollections
of incidents and impressions that were painful
or pleasurable at the time, and which are now seen to
have had an influence, more or less decided, upon the
whole after life. In this state of reflection sat one day
the man we have here introduced. After musing for a
long time, deeply abstracted, he took up his pen and
wrote hastily—and these were the sentences he traced
upon the paper that lay before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How <a id='indel'></a>indelibly does a little act of kindness, performed
at the right moment, impress itself upon the
mind. We meet, as we pass through the world, so
much of rude selfishness, that we guard ourselves
against it, and scarcely feel its effects. But spontaneous
kindness comes so rarely, that we are surprised when
it appears, and delighted and refreshed as by the perfume
of flowers in the dreary winter. When we were
a small boy, an orphan, and with the memory of a
home forever lost too vivid in our young heart, a man,
into whose beautiful garden we stood looking, pulled a
few flowers, and handed them through the fence, speaking
a kind word as he did so. He did not know, and
perhaps never will know, how deeply we were touched
by his act. From a little boy we loved the flowers,
and ere that heaviest affliction a child ever knows—the
loss of parents—fell upon us, we almost lived
among them. But death separated between us and
all those tender associations and affections that, to the
hearts of children, are like dew to the tender grass.
We entered the dwelling of a stranger, and were treated
thenceforth as if we had, or ought to have, no feelings,
no hopes, no weaknesses. The harsh command came
daily and almost hourly to our ears; and not even for
work well done, or faithful service, were we cheered
by words of commendation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day—we were not more than eleven years old—something
turned our thoughts back upon the earlier
and happier time when we had a true home, and <a id='were'></a>were
loved and cared for. We were once more in the
garden and among the sweet blossoms, as of old, and
the mother, on whose bosom we had slept, sat under
the grape arbor while we filled her lap with flowers.
There was a smile of love on her dear face, and her
lips were parting with some word of affection, when,
to scatter into nothing these dear images of the lonely
boy, came the sharp command of a master, and in
obedience we started forth to perform some needed
service. Our way was by the garden of which we
have spoken; and it was on this occasion, and while
the suddenly dissipated image of our mother among
the flowers was re-forming itself in our young imagination,
that the incident to which we have alluded
occurred. We can never forget the grateful perfume
of those flowers, nor the strength and comfort which
the kind words and manner of the giver imparted to
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
our fainting spirit. We took them home, and kept
them fresh as long as water would preserve their life
and beauty; and when they faded, and the leaves fell,
pale and withered, upon the ground, we grieved for
their loss as if a real friend had been taken away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a long, long time since that incident occurred;
but the flowers which there sprung up in our bosom,
are fresh and beautiful still. They have neither faded
nor withered—they cannot, for they are unfading
flowers. We never looked upon the man who gave
them to us that our heart did not grow warm toward
him. We know not now whether he be living or dead.
Twenty years ago we lost sight of him; but, if still
among the dwellers of earth, and in need of a friend,
we would divide with him our last morsel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old man, with hair whitened by the snows of
many winters, was sitting in a room that was poorly
supplied with furniture, his head bowed down, and
gaze cast dreamily upon the floor. A pale young girl
came in while he thus sat musing. Lifting his eyes
to her face, he said, while he tried to look cheerful,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen, dear, you must not go out to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel a great deal better, grandpa,” returned the
girl, forcing a smile. “I am able to go to work again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child, you are not,” said the old man, firmly;
“and you must not think of such a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be so positive, grandpa.” And as she uttered
this little sentence, in a half playful voice, she laid her
hand among the thin gray locks on the old man’s head,
and smoothed them caressingly. “You know that I
must not be idle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, child, until your strength returns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our wants will not wait, grandpa.” As the girl
said this, her face became sober. The old man’s eyes
again fell to the floor, and a heavy sigh came forth
from his bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be very careful and not overwork myself
again,” resumed Ellen, after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not go to-day,” said the old man, arousing
himself. “It is murder. Wait at least until to-morrow.
You will be stronger then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I do not go back to-day, I may lose my place.
You know I have been home for three days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Work will not wait. The last time I was kept
away by sickness, a customer was disappointed; and
there was a good deal of trouble about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another sigh came heavily from the old man’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go,” said the girl. “Perhaps they will let
me off for a day longer. If so, I will come back.
But I must not lose the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No further resistance was made by the old man.
In a little while he was alone. Hours went by, but
Ellen did not return. She had gone to work. Her
employer would not let her go away, feeble as she
was, without a forfeiture of her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About mid-day, finding that Ellen did not come back,
the old man, after taking some food, went out. The
pressure of seventy years was upon him, and his steps
were slow and carefully taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must get something to do. I can work still,” he
muttered to himself, as he moved along the streets.
“The dear child is killing herself, and all for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what could he do? Who wanted the services
of an old man like him, whose mind had lost its clearness,
whose step faltered, and whose hand was no
longer steady? In vain he made application for employment.
Younger and more vigorous men filled all
the places, and he was pushed aside. Discouraged
and drooping in spirit, he went back to his home, and
there awaited the fall of evening, which was to bring
the return of the only being left on earth to love him.
At night-fall Ellen came in. Her face, so pale in the
morning, was now slightly flushed; and her eyes were
brighter than when she went out. The grandfather
was not deceived by this; he knew it as the sign of
disease. He took her hand—it was hot; and when he
bent to kiss her gentle lips, he found them burning with
fever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen, my child, why did you go to work to-day?
I knew it would make you sick,” the old man said, in
a voice of anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen tried to smile and to appear not so very ill; but
nature was too much oppressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I brought home some work, and will not go out to-morrow,”
she remarked. “I think the walk fatigued
me more than any thing else. I will feel better in
the morning, after a good night’s sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the girl’s hope failed in this. The morning
found her so weak that she could not rise from bed;
and when her grandfather came into her room to learn
how she had passed the night, he found her weeping
on her pillow. She had endeavored to get up, but her
head, which was aching terribly, grew dizzy, and she
fell back under a despairing consciousness that her
strength was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed, but Ellen did not grow better. The
fever still kept her body prostrate. Once or twice,
when her grandfather was out of the room, she took
the work she had brought home, and tried to do some
of it while sitting up in bed. But ere a minute had
passed, she became faint, while all grew dark around
her. She was no better when night came. If her
mind could have rested—if she had been free from
anxious and distressing thoughts, nature would have
had some power to react, but as it was, the pressure
upon her was too great. She could not forget that
they had scarcely so much money as a dollar left, and
that her old grandfather was too feeble to work. Upon
her rested all the burden of their support, and she was
now helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next morning Ellen was better. She could
sit up without feeling dizzy, though her head still ached,
and the fever had only slightly abated. But the old
man would not permit her to leave the bed, though she
begged him earnestly to let her do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bundle of work that Ellen had brought home,
was wrapped in a newspaper, and this her grandfather
took up to read some time during the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Mr. T——’s newspaper,” said he, as he
opened it, and saw the title. “I knew T—— when
he was a poor little orphan boy. But, of course, he
don’t remember me. He’s prospered wonderfully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then his eyes went along the columns of the
paper, and he read aloud to Ellen such things as he
thought would interest her. Among others was a reminiscence
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>
by the editor—the same that we have just
given. The old man’s voice faltered as he read. The
little incident, so feelingly described, had long since
been hidden in his memory under the gathering dust
of time. But now the dust was swept away, and he
saw his own beautiful garden. He was in it and among
the flowers; and wishfully looking through the fence
stood the orphan boy. He remembered having felt
pity for him, and he remembered now as distinctly as
if it were but yesterday, though thirty years had intervened,
the light that went over the child’s face as he
handed him a few flowers that were to fade and
wither in a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, the old man’s voice faltered while he read;
and when he came to the last sentence, the paper
dropped upon the floor, and clasping his hands together,
he lifted his dim eyes upward, while his lips moved in
whispered words of thankfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ails you, grandpa?” asked Ellen, in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old man did not seem to hear her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear grandpa,” repeated the girl, “why do you
look so strangely?” She had risen in bed, and was
bending toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen, child,” said the old man, a light breaking
over his countenance, as though a sunbeam had suddenly
come into the room, “it was your old grandfather
who gave the flowers to that poor little boy.
Did you hear what he said?—he would divide his last
morsel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man moved about the room with his unsteady
steps, talking in a wandering way, so overjoyed
at the prospect of relief for his child, that he was
nearly beside himself. But there yet lingered some
embers of pride in his heart; and from these the ashes
were blown away, and they became bright and glowing.
The thought of asking a favor as a return for that little
act, which was to him, at the time, a pleasure, came
with a feeling of reluctance. But when he looked at
the pale young girl who lay with her eyes closed and
her face half buried in the pillow, he murmured to himself,
“It is for you—for you!” And taking up his staff,
he went tottering forth into the open air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The editor was sitting in his office, writing, when he
heard the door open, and turning, he saw before him
an old man with bent form and snowy head. Something
in the visiter’s countenance struck him as familiar;
but he did not recognize him as one whom he
had seen before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Mr. T—— in?” inquired the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is T——,” replied the editor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You?” There was a slight expression of surprise
in the old man’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am T——, my friend,” was kindly said.
“Can I do any thing for you? Take this chair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The offered seat was accepted; and as the old
man sunk into it, his countenance and manner betrayed
his emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come,” said he, and his voice was unsteady,
“to do what I could not do for myself alone. But I
cannot see my poor, sick grandchild wear out and die
under the weight of burdens that are too heavy to be
borne. For her sake I have conquered my own
pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” said T——, who was looking at the old
man earnestly, and endeavoring to fix his identity in
his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your face is not entirely strange,” said T——. “It
must have been a long time since we met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long? Oh yes! It is a long, long time. You
were a boy, and I unbent by age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Markland!” exclaimed T——, with sudden energy,
springing to his feet as the truth flashed upon him.
“Say—is it so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Markland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do we meet again thus!” said T——, with
emotion, as he grasped the old man’s hand. “Ah, sir,
I have never forgotten you. When a sad-hearted boy,
you spoke to me kindly, and the words comforted me
when I had no other comfort. The bunch of flowers
you gave me—you remember it, no doubt—are still
fresh in my heart. Not a leaf has faded. They are
as bright and green, and full of perfume as when I first
hid them there; and there they will bloom forever—the
unfading flowers of gratitude. I am glad you have
come, though grieved that your declining years are
made heavier by misfortune. Heaven has smiled on
my efforts in the world. I have enough, and to spare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not come for charity,” returned Markland.
“I have hands, and they would not be idle, though it
is not much that they can accomplish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be not troubled on that account, my friend,” was
kindly answered. “I will find something for you to
do. But first tell me all about yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus encouraged, the old man told his story. It was
the common history of loss of property and friends, and
the approach of want with declining years. T—— saw
that pride and native independence were still strong
in Markland’s bosom, feeble as he was, and really unable
to enter upon any serious employment; and his
first impulse was to save his feelings at the same time
that he extended to him entire and permanent relief.
This he found no difficulty in doing, and the old man
was soon after placed in a situation where but little
application was necessary, while the income was all-sufficient
for the comfortable support of himself and
grandchild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flowers offered with a purely humane feeling,
proved to be fadeless flowers; and their beauty and
perfume came back to the senses of the giver when all
other flowers were dead or dying on his dark and
dreary way.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LABRADOR AUK, OR PUFFIN. (<span class='it'>Fratercula Arctica.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We have already remarked that there are but two
species of the true Auk. The Puffin belongs to the
sub-genus Fratercula. Of the singular figure of this
bird our engraving gives a true representation; of its
habits, Selby gives the following account, which is
corroborated by other writers who have described it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Although the Puffin is found in very high latitudes,
and its distribution through the Arctic Circle is extensive,
it is only known to us as a summer visitant, and
that from the south, making its first appearance in the
vicinity of its breeding stations, about the middle of
April, and regularly departing between the 10th and
the 20th of August. Many resort to the islands, selecting
such as are covered with a stratum of vegetable
mould; and here they dig their own burrows, from
there not being any rabbits to dispossess upon the particular
islets they frequent. They commence this
operation about the first week in May, and the hole is
generally excavated to the depth of three feet, often in
a curving direction, and occasionally with two entrances.
When engaged in digging, which is principally
performed by the males, they are sometimes so
intent on their work as to admit of being taken by
hand, and the same may also be done during incubation.
At this period I have frequently obtained specimens,
by thrusting my arm into the burrow, though at
the risk of receiving a severe bite from the powerful
and sharp edged bill of the old bird. At the farther
end of this hole the single egg is deposited, which in
size nearly equals that of a pullet, and, as Pennant observes,
varies in form; in some instances one end being
acute, and in others equally obtuse. Its color
when first laid is white, but it becomes soiled and
dirty from its immediate contact with the earth: no
materials being collected for a nest at the end of the
burrow. The young are hatched after a month’s incubation,
and are then covered with a long blackish
down above, which gradually gives place to the
feathered plumage, so that at the end of a month or
five weeks they are able to quit the burrow, and follow
their parents to the open sea. Soon after this
time, or about the second week in August, the whole
leave our coasts, commencing their equatorial migration.
At an early age the bill of this bird is small and
narrow, scarcely exceeding that of the young Razor-bill
at the same period of life; and not till after the
second year does this member acquire its full development,
both as to depth, color, and its transverse furrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In rocky places, they deposit their single egg in the
holes and crevices. The length of the bird is about
twelve inches. The half of the bill nearest the head
is bluish; the rest red. The corners of the mouth are
puckered into a kind of star. The legs and feet are
orange. The plumage is black and white, with the
exception of the cheeks and chin, which are sometimes
gray. The young, pickled with spices, are
sometimes considered dainties.”</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LITTLE AUK. (<span class='it'>Mergulus Melano Leukos.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Little Auk, or Sea Dove, is an example of the
genus Mergulus. It braves the inclemency of very
high latitudes, and is found in immense flocks on the
inhospitable coasts of Greenland, Spitsbergen, and
Melville Island. Here they watch the motion of the
ice, and when it is broken up by storms, “they come
down in legions, crowding into every fissure, to banquet
on the crustaceous and other marine animals
which lie there at their mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Little Auk is between nine and ten inches in
length; the bill is black and the legs inclining to brown;
the plumage is black and white; and in winter the
front of the neck, which is black in summer, becomes
whitish. It lays but one egg, of a pale, bluish green,
on the most inaccessible ledges of the precipices which
overhang the ocean.” Such are the accounts of the
naturalists and voyagers who have visited the arctic
regions. With its name of Sea Dove, its apparently
delicate structure, and its daring and heroic habits of
life, it affords a most inviting theme to the poet.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The waning year is, to most minds, a season of reflection.
And it is good to pause and think, occasionally; to
glance along the receding vista of months, and review our
actions ere too great a distance makes their memory indistinct.
Time seems to linger on his journey, to pause
by the crumbling ruins of earthly things, and point us to
the past, that we may gather therefrom lessons of wisdom
for the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, as we stand on the verge of the parting year—as
the last line in its record of events is about being
written, it is but to obey the dictate of reason to let our
thoughts run back. Time we cannot recall, nor change
the past. What we have done is done forever. Then,
why, it may be asked, turn our thoughts thitherward?
Why not look in hope to the future? It is that we may
look to the future with brighter hopes, made more certain
through repentance and good resolutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What we are is of more, far more importance to us than
what we seem to others, or what we have gained in
worldly goods. Our thoughts, then, as we review the
days and weeks in the closing circle of months, should
linger rather upon the purposes and acts of our moral life,
than upon the impression we have made upon others, or
the amount of earthly treasure we have gathered in from
the harvest-fields of the world. A good reputation may
be lost through slander; riches may take to themselves
wings and fly away; but of the heart’s conscious rectitude
no event external to ourselves can rob us. It is true
gold, which neither moth nor rust can corrupt, and of
which not even death itself can rob us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In turning back our thoughts upon the past, then, let us
examine all our acts in the light of their prompting ends.
There is no act without a purpose, and the purpose gives
quality to the act. A selfish and bad end makes an act
evil, which might be innocent if done with a good end.
A man may pursue his worldly business with the same
energy and success that marks the course of his neighbor,
and be all the while laying up treasure above, while the
latter gains nothing but the treasure on earth, which, in a
few years, passes into the coffers of another, while he,
naked and poor as he came into the world, recrosses the
mortal bourne, and is seen no more among his fellows.
The great difference lies in the end with which each prosecutes
his daily calling. A good end keeps in view what
is just to the neighbor, while a selfish end causes a man
to disregard and even trample upon <a id='other'></a>others’ rights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As time points his trembling finger to the past, let each
one, then, carefully review the history of the year, so far
as himself is concerned, and, in reviewing it, look earnestly
at the purposes which have governed his various
actions. These, in their accumulations, are to make the
future happy or miserable. Gold gained in a total disregard
of <a id='oth'></a>others’ rights or feelings, never has nor never will
bring happiness; for, in the acquisition, the mind takes
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
an evil form in accordance with its purpose, and such a
form precludes the possibility of happiness. Honor and
fame acquired in like manner, will as certainly bring pain
and disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great question then is—How far have I advanced
in the year toward that true humanity which is built up
into a beautiful form, through good purposes coming forth
into good deeds? Just so far as this true humanity has
been attained, <span class='it'>and no further</span>, has the waning year been a
well spent and profitable year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is your mind not satisfied with the review measured by
this standard? Let the fact be wisely improved by a better
life in the future. Begin the next year with this
higher standard in your mind, and resolve to live up to it
as far as is in your power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one reflection connected with this theme that
should produce a strong impression. It is our present
that makes our future. What we purpose and do to-day
throws forward its effect upon our coming years. And
this is the result of every day’s life. What would not
some of us give if we could change the rebuking past?
But, alas! what is done is done forever. The present
with its deeds flits by and becomes the unchangeable past.
We may repent of our wrong doings, but repentance
cannot extract the sting from memory. With this thought,
which should alone prompt to right living in the future,
we close our brief sermon; commending its teachings to
the wise and simple, the rich and the poor, the old and the
young, the learned and the unlearned, with the hope that
it may be like a nail in a sure place, or, like apples of gold
on pictures of silver.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE POLITICAL WORLD FOR 1849.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.9em;'>BY J. R. CHANDLER.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems meet that we should take some note of the
times in which we live, and not allow a whole year to
pass without a record of some of those startling incidents
by which it has been distinguished. We do not pretend to
publish “the news”—we do not mean to make commentaries
upon the political changes which are constantly occurring.
There are papers specially devoted to such matters,
and they do their duty with fidelity and satisfaction.
We, however, think it proper (useful we mean, and therefore
proper,) to give a simple abstract of great political
changes and convulsions that have occurred in 1849. It
may instruct some; it will probably send many more to
the records of the times to gain minute information of such
startling affairs. Some it may lead to reflect upon the
mutability of human productions, and the causes which
have wrought out such remarkable effects. Others will
probably be ready, while they mourn over the suffering and
kindle at the bold steps and courageous conduct of the uprising
oppressed, abroad, to rejoice at the peace and happiness
secured to our own beloved country by the institutions
of republicanism which we enjoy, and to inquire
whether such signal advantages are not worth a vigilance
that shall detect the first movement, or the dangerous
neglect that may jeopard the liberties of the people and
the peace and prosperity of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We desire to sit down and make a small daguerreotype
view of the nations abroad, that our Magazine may
close the year 1849 with such a picture as would make
ordinary readers, even the ladies, who are only ordinary
as they are the <span class='it'>general</span> readers of our book, understand
the changes which are yet to take place. But we are
compelled to write nearly a month before we nominally
publish, so that much may transpire between the inkstand
and the reading-desk; much that may change the whole
complexion, the features even of European politics, and
cast either a shade or a light across the Atlantic. Again,
while we sit down to adjust our instrument to catch the
manners living as they rise, to receive and fix the forms
of nations upon our plates, they, instead of awaiting their
little moment, to give a perfect image, start into some revolution
and thus mar the picture which we would have
strong, clear and distinct. The troubles which beset the
whole of Italy a year ago are, if not settled, at least
becoming less. The affairs of the various independent
governments seem to be so directed as to insure a return
to something like the position they held more than two
years since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='sc'>Rome</span>, whence the Pope had been driven by the revolutionary
power, the French army in Italy established
itself, after a free use of its heavy batteries. For a moment
it seemed that nothing more was intended than the
restoration of the Pope to his temporal power. But either
the President of France had a concealed motive in sending
Oudinot with an army into Italy, or the uplifted voice
of the liberal portion of Europe caused him to declare that
he wished to prevent Austria and Spain from gaining influence
in Rome, and he desired with the return of the
Pope, to see the government (under his holiness) secularized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the Pope, at Gaeta, apparently enjoying all
the distinction which his elevated position as spiritual and
temporal chief could claim, has been far from happy. He
has seen into the motives of France, and cannot be ignorant
now of the spirit, the interested spirit, likely to influence
other nations which may undertake to restore him
to Rome with all his former power. Nay, it is evident
that he is now weighing the consideration whether it is
best for his spiritual mission, and his temporal comforts
and honors to receive back such rule—he sees that the
times have changed, and he is evidently pausing to see
how he may change with them without exposing himself
to the outrages to which his former liberal movements exposed
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Venice</span> that held out against the Austrian forces was
compelled to capitulate. She loses the distinction which
she had retained, and her condition as a free port is lost.
Austria has even desired to build up Trieste at the expense
of Venice. It should be remarked, however, that the political
offences of the Venetians have been more leniently
dealt with than had been anticipated. The leaders of the
revolt were removed to Corfu by the French before the
Austrians entered the city. Venice and Venetian Lombardy
are again the appanages of the Austrian crown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an attempt at a revolt in the <span class='sc'>Ionian Islands</span>,
a quasi republic under the protection of Great Britain.
The disturbance took place in Cephalonia, and the political
outbreak was the occasion for a band of ruffians to undertake
to plunder and assassinate. A leading citizen of Argistile
was, with his family, burnt to death. Vigorous
measures were adopted by Mr. Ward, the high commissioner
of the British government for the Ionian Islands, and
finally order was restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>France</span>—The year 1849 opened upon France in the enjoyment
of the <span class='it'>fierce</span> youth of Republicanism, with a President
elected almost unanimously by the people, and with
a National Assembly almost ready to expire by its own
peculiar organization. A new Assembly was elected and
was organized in May, and early in June the President,
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, sent to that body his message,
which, for the first time in European history, contained a
statement of the situation of the country minutely set
forth, and was thus far republican. Unfortunately the
President took occasion to set forth his own views and
determinations in a tone far more in accordance with those
of his uncle, the Emperor Napoleon, than like that of those
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
who should supply his model—the Presidents of the United
States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be noted that the revolutions of France have been
very costly, and her debt has been fearfully augmented by
the convulsion that drove Louis Philippe from the kingly
throne and placed Louis Napoleon in the <a id='pres'></a>presidential
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The election of Louis Napoleon to the presidency did by
no means secure the tranquillity of France; so many men
leading various sections, that united only <span class='it'>against</span> one portion,
were unprovided with power when the union was to be
in <span class='it'>favor</span> of one man, that no sooner was the president installed
than those who had done most to make a place for
him were willing to do more to get him out of a place. And
it cannot be denied that the movements of France, or rather
of Louis Napoleon, for really he seems to be France, upon
Rome, were not at first calculated to conciliate the Red
Republicans, and are now as little likely to satisfy the opposite
party; each will remember its peculiar cause of
dislike, but neither will keep in mind its occasion for approval.
The truth is, France is not yet essentially republican
in its system. The people of France would, by a
large majority, vote to fight for a republican form of government
for their country, but they do not seem to comprehend
the true policy of a republic, and it may be doubted
whether the tendency of a single legislature, and the weight
of Paris is not toward centralization—most anti or at least
unrepublican. France must look to the federation of her
departments. The president of France has made various
tours in his republic, and has been received with various
degrees of respect and courtesy, as his principles were
more or less approved, or, perhaps, as the people were
more or less republican or monarchical in their views. And
it may be remarked, that every where he has taken occasion
to say that “order, system, and conservatism,” were
necessary to the prosperity of France; an idea well enough
in the abstract, but evidently, considering the speaker and
the hearers, intended to intimate that France needed less
revolution among the people, and more permanency in her
executive. When he visited the neighborhood of Ham,
where he had been for a long time a prisoner, on account
of a rebellion against the established government, he was
reminded by some obsequious citizens of his sufferings and
his deliverance. But instead of launching out into a
tirade against tyranny in general, and especially that
which confined him there, he took occasion to preach a
homily in favor of established power, and confessed his
error in being one of those who rose against it. Fenelon,
when he ascended the pulpit to denounce his own book,
did not assume a more self-condemnatory air, nor did he
more regret his offences against ecclesiastical rule, than
did Louis Napoleon <span class='it'>his</span> outrage upon the kingly government;
and this, too, in presence of a people that had
assisted within two years to put down a king, and had,
by their votes, elected him to office, in the place of that
king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>France has placed herself, or was placed by her president,
in a very delicate position, with regard to other European
powers, by her interference in the Italian contest. She
now complains that the Pope does not acknowledge the
services which she has rendered, (he certainty seems to be
very ignorant of any advantage which France has wrought
for him,) while the president declares that Rome must be
secularized, and must grant a <span class='it'>full</span> amnesty to political
offenders. France has her attention now drawn toward
the peculiar situation of affairs between the Porte and the
Emperor of Russia, in which England and France seem
to understand each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the continent of Europe has been embroiled for
the last year in all kinds of contests, <span class='sc'>Great Britain</span> seems to
have enjoyed unusual tranquillity at <span class='it'>home</span>. The imperial
parliament repealed the old navigation laws which had
been operative for two centuries. By the new enactments
greater freedom is given to vessels of other countries to
trade between the several ports of Great Britain; and in
other countries where reciprocal commercial treaties are
established, the ships of Great Britain will have similar
advantages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peace is not productive of historical interest, and we
have only to say, that Great <a id='brit'></a>Britain has settled her troubles
in the East by defeating the Indian forces raised against
her power; and she has commenced her troubles in the
<span class='it'>West</span>, by sanctioning certain laws passed by the parliament
of the Canadas to remunerate those who lost property
in a former rebellion. The truth is, there has grown
up a strong and violent hostility between the English residents
in Canada and the French; and the latter, with
some of their allies, having a majority, passed the law for
indemnity, which the governor, Lord Elgin, signed; and
this brought against him the English party. The Home
Government sanctioned the action of his lordship, and this
has led some of the English party to talk of throwing off
the English yoke, and uniting Canada with the United
States. It is probable that Great Britain has held Canada
about as long as is possible—and perhaps quite as long
as is profitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Queen of Great Britain has, with her husband and
children, attended by a numerous court, been visiting to
Ireland and Scotland, and has been eminently successful
in conciliating the people of these parts of her empire, and
has done more to restore kind feelings and establish herself,
than all the arms which she could have sent against
the disaffected. She is at once popular and powerful, and
sustains a bad system by her gentleness and her sterling
worth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to the glory of Great Britain that in all the disturbances
in Europe of late, she has sought, by her intervention,
to save the people from the consequences of a bloody
war, and in all cases she has appeared as the friend of the
weakest side, her mediation was not often accepted. In the
case of the unhappy war between Prussia and Denmark,
about the miserable affair of Schleswick Holstein, her offer
was accepted, and peace was restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Denmark.</span> We have little to say of this kingdom excepting
that by her superior naval force she redeemed her
credit, somewhat impaired by the success of the Prussians
on the land; and the effective blockade induced her enemy
to listen to the proposition of Great Britain to mediate.
The result was the settlement of the difficulties about
Schleswick Holstein.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Prussia.</span> The attempt to create a federative government
in Germany has not yet proved successful. Various
plans have been proposed, and a constitution, not unlike
that of the United States, was nearly adopted. But when the
states which are to compose the federation have been so long
entirely independent, and have exercised the privileges of
complete sovereignty, they do not readily yield up their
independence, and hence, after moving toward a union,
they start off, alarmed at the chance of being lost sight of
in the shadow of the larger states. The intention of forming
a confederacy is still cherished, and may be realized.
Prussia must, of course, have a leading voice in such a
movement. But the power of the continental monarchs
rests, and must continue to rest, upon the army, and consequently
war, that weakens the nation, must, for a time,
give strength to kings. But as the strength which is imparted
to the human system by the use of opium, it will
destroy in time what it was intended to support.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Austria</span> has had a sort of triumph; her arms have been
successful in Italy, and, with the aid of Russia, she has
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
put down the rebellion in Hungary. Yet Austria is
weaker now than before her triumphs, and is regarded
with less favor, more hatred, more contempt than formerly.
The necessity of changes in her government; the necessity
of destroying her own rebellious cities; the necessity of
applying to Russia for help, have taught that power to
feel that it is not only vulnerable, but that it is perishable.
And a few more such convulsions, even though Russia interfere,
will dismember the Germans, and set free her injured
dependencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Hungary.</span> The brilliant effort of Hungary to cast off the
yoke of Austria promised for a time to be gloriously successful.
The character of Kossuth was so beautiful, his
manners so conciliatory, his plans so wise, and his power
with the army so complete, that the world was prepared
to hail and welcome the old kingdom back to independence.
Austria was defeated. Her armies were beaten, and the
<a id='rick'></a>rickety old tyranny appealed to Russia for help—to Russia,
the last refuge of tyranny that exists. And Russia poured
her <span class='it'>rubles</span> down upon the plains of Hungary, and corrupted
one of the generals that had been entrusted with power;
and then she sent her herds of serfs and generals to receive
the concessions which she had <span class='it'>purchased</span>. And so
Hungary sinks back into a dependence upon Austria, liable
at all times to be claimed and fleeced by Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had wished, we confess, that Hungary would have
freed herself—but she must abide her time. Bem, Kossuth,
and many other generals, with numerous companies of
soldiery, escaped into the Turkish dominions, under a
pledge of safety from the Sultan. But Russia, true to her
principle of pursuing her offenders, demanded these unfortunate
fugitives. The Sultan became alarmed, and
asked the Hungarians to renounce their faith, and adopt
Mohamedism, and then they would become citizens, and
might not be claimed. Some assumed the turban, others
refused. But it is probable that Russia will find occasion
in these and other matters to make war on Turkey; if so,
France and England must look to what they have called
the balance of power in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is worthy of remark, that while Russia is settling the
disturbance in Hungary, the western principalities of Turkey
seem to be uniting with Greece to assert some of the
rights of man. We know not what will result—but it appears
as if there was going forth a voice which is crying
“<span class='it'>war—war</span> to tyranny and oppression!” Its denunciation
may indeed serve to make the hand of power clutch
more closely the neck of its victim, but the grasp must be
spasmodic—strong, perhaps stronger than formerly, at
least, the neck is growing more sensitive—but the grasp
will be loosed, and the people will be allowed to go and
form their own government and enjoy their own rights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There have been few changes on this side of the Atlantic.
The most important movements have been in California,
where the tide of immigration attracted by gold
and retained by a new feeling of civicism, has swollen into
the materials for a new government. The opinion entertained
at one time that the attempt to form a territorial
government for California would embarrass the National
Administration by giving rise to the question of the extent
of slavery, by the application of what is called the “Wilmot
proviso,” seems to have subsided by the project of inducing
California to make application at once for admission
into the Union as a <span class='it'>State</span>, of course the Wilmot
proviso would have no operation on such an appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No changes of consequence have occurred in South
America. Improvement in the sciences, peace, and order
will strengthen republican institutions, and republican
feelings, and we may hope that prosperity and happiness
will ere long be the lot of those whom Providence has
placed in a Heavenly climate and on a most productive
soil, but whose stimulated passions have made a hell of
their country, and denied to the soil the produce which it
might have brought forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Excepting the fearful prevalence of cholera in various
parts of the country, the <span class='sc'>United States</span> have continued
in the enjoyment of political, moral, and social blessings;
and we may hope that Providence will continue to smile
on the efforts of its patriots to sustain the institutions
with which their country is blessed, and to make each
citizen sensible of the vast advantages he enjoys over the
subjects of foreign powers. And if God, who hitherto has
poured out his choicest favors on our beloved land, should
vouchsafe his blessings hereafter, we may see her wielding
power for the good of mankind, and teaching other
nations the true use of government. Not doubting but
this will be the case, we think we see down the vista of
time our country becoming the mild dictator to the world,
and her peaceful government sheltering the injured from
other lands and correcting the injurer. And while such a
prospect is held out we may look, as the cause and consequence
thereof, for peace and moral worth, and</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PROSPECTIVE!—1850.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My dear Jeremy</span>,—Have you ever taken a long-bill on
the wing of a July morning? Not a note at eight months,
flying in the market at a heavy discount—but a genuine
long-bill, an old woodcock, springing up at your feet with
whistling and whirring wings, and doing his uttermost
to get out of the way, without waiting for the formality
of invitation expended upon a certain Mr. Tucker? “You
have not.” Well, I shall not attempt the task of teacher
after <span class='sc'>Herbert</span>, but you can have no conception of the
cool head and steady nerve required to do it well. To an
old hand, with dog and gun, with a constitution inured by
exercise, it is the glory of the world’s excitements, and as
far above the lust of money-getting, as poetry is above
note-shaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took my tramp this summer, of three months, among
the hills and marshes where this bird—which is a bore in
one way only—loves most to congregate, and saw our old
friend, “the iron pump” of copper notoriety looking as dry
as his purchasers and quite as rusty. I could not resist the
impulse to take a crack at him, at forty yards, with my
double-barrel, as at an imaginary copper-head. The excavations
looked like the ready-made graves of speculators,
who somehow or other had not come there to be buried.
The very faces of the rocks had been twisted into grimaces,
and seemed with their yellow eyes to be grinning at one;
so shouldering my gun, and whistling to give strength to
an imaginary band playing</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I went down into the valley, and took vengeance for
bills long dishonored, upon bills that I honor long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, Jeremy, we cannot submit to the “vagabond propensity,”
as the old farmers call it, of roaming with dog
and gun over mountain and meadow, though the morning
dew has made the air redolent of sweets, and from every
bush and blade of grass nature has hung her pearls invitingly,
and lit up, as with the blaze of a torch, the gum and
maple trees; though the pure air and fresh water have
given health to eye and cheek and vigor to the frame, we
must away to the turbulent city, and within its pent up
streets and among its crowded artisans and tradesmen
wrestle for bread, and shutting out from the heart its
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
glimpses of heaven and repose in the country, grapple with
toil, work on, and hope on! Yet with a sure and an
abiding trust and faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the opening of the New Year the periodical campaign
brings thought and labor. What a world within
itself is this business in Philadelphia alone—how stirring
the competition—how diverse the interests—how various
the success. The unparalleled rise in the business within
one short year has been the result of diligent application.
The publishers have most gloriously bought their own
success, and have raised their works to such a point of
beauty and excellence that money can go no further. The
spirit of a just competition has urged each man to do his
very uttermost to give his readers all that can by possibility
be crowded, in the way of beauty and excellence,
into his work. Every dollar received goes back in renewed
outlay, in costly embellishments and articles. Nothing
in Europe at twice their price can at all approach
the illustrated American Monthlies in the beauty and costliness
of their appointments. At the head of <span class='it'>all</span> stands
“<span class='sc'>Graham</span>”—Proud—Imperious—Supreme. He has no
long line of broken promises to come up in judgment
against him, but for ten long years has steadily gone on
increasing in the face of all opposition, until he now
stands unapproachable and alone, among the highest class
of literary monthlies in the land. There are others of a
lighter class—successful—highly successful—but his is
the proud honor of having lifted the tone of his literature,
and the quality of his engravings, up to the highest European
standard of excellence in all respects. There is yet
another class, who deal in promises—and promises only—whose
best numbers come up to the meanest promise only
of their printed circulars, but who go on crowding promise
upon failure to redeem, until the virtues of their acts
are lost in the fog they raise—fortunately their works also.
More than a score of such have we seen entombed—some
we have helped to bury—but they come again, like the
locust, annually, and swindling a few dupes out of their
money, annually die. This is the class which does business
altogether by</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SUCTION AND PUMPING PROCESS.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i160.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0010' style='width:95%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>From this party, we shall no doubt be favored, with very
extravagant-looking show-bills, and plenty of them—long
bills drawn upon the credulity of people who fill an imaginary
subscription list, and are very liberal in remittances,
and whose wonderful sagacity in waiting until 1850, will
be duly heralded, and in type announced. The existence
of any periodical of the slightest pretension to elegance or
ability, not having been heard of before, and only known
among that benighted class, whose urgent literary tastes
would not allow them to suffer and to wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having seen our friends of “The Suction and Pumping
Process” fairly in the field, let us survey the ground. On
the whole, things look rather brilliant; a number of
“new volumes with superb inducements,” are already announced,
and with the usual cheering before starting, the
entertainments for 1850 promise to be rich and various beyond
parallel. Ingenuity, it seems, is not exhausted, nor
are novelties entirely run out. What have we here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the ladies’ magazines actually promises to “<span class='it'>outstrip</span>”
all its cotemporaries! A novel sort of assertion, truly,
for a genteel ladies’ magazine; yet a proceeding, one would
think, that cannot be carried very far with any sort of propriety.
The grace of modesty and the delicacy of its position
alike forbid it. Such things, if really attempted, will
drive the meeker and weaker brethren entirely from the
contest. We may—but scarcely can—tolerate the pretty
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
large liberties which have been taken with the dresses of
ladies elsewhere in engravings and fashion plates. Let it
stop here. Give us models of art, even if they are a little
nude; we can stand that—but this is touching on the province
of the model artists; and as the <span class='it'>elder</span> magazine, we
cannot allow it—positively. Jeremy, if you have any
influence with these people, stop this thing, I pray you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phew!—but what <span class='it'>is</span> this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears that under cover of fire-works, with sky-rockets,
blue-lights, shooting-stars, or something of that
sort, we are to have a grand conflagration, perhaps immolation
of fashionable and pretty women; for another
ladies’ magazine, audaciously—in order to offset the other,
we suppose—promises, “<span class='it'>a blaze of beauty throughout the
year!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is actually put out in the bills, before a Christian
country, in the nineteenth century, and the police look on,
and are silent!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! this comes home to “our hearts and our bussums.”
<span class='it'>What do we read? “All</span> the distinguished writers and
authors of this country and Europe are engaged.” The
deuce they are? Oh Lord!—Our office then may be
closed, during business hours hereafter, we suppose.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Overlooked, by George!</span>—News! news! “The acknowledged
Blackwood of America, 1850.” Now is that old
vagabond coming back again, after having enjoyed our
hospitalities for two seasons—’42 and ’43?</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Blackwood were to come in spirit shape, this I think
would be his story, Jeremy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see I was coming along, when a tall fellow,
our old friend, cries, ‘How are you, Mr. Blackwood?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Come in here,’ says he, seizing my elbow, and in an
instant I found myself deceived, swindled, jostled in among
the wrong set. A parcel of puritanical looking dogs,
sitting cheek by jowl, with long gowns, play actors,
medical students, penny-a-liners, seedy old boys and silly
school girls. I suppose they took me for a Mormon or a
Shaker, or perhaps a clown, and dragged me in, to add to
the novelty of the collection. But Scotch manners
wouldn’t allow me to be rude, so I said, very politely, to
the tall gentleman, if <span class='it'>that</span> is whisky-punch you have on
the stove, I’ll take a tumbler of it. Heavens! you should
have heard the yell that went up, and seen the horrible
faces; so seeing the way the wind set, I gave one or two
of them a knock over the skull with ebony—bestowed my
parting benediction upon the whole company—ladies excepted—and
came at once to head-quarters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Jeremy, I don’t know what you may think of this
business, but I say I have been silent long enough under
various aggressions, and hereafter, I take the cudgel and
trounce any son of a gun who poaches on my manor.
Why do you know that people have the audacity to say
that theirs is the <span class='it'>oldest</span> magazine, when the Casket, which
we bought, and on which Graham was based, started in
1826, and had its colored fashions and wood engravings
printed on tinted paper long before any of them opened
their eyes. The mezzotints I was the first to put to magazine
use on a large scale; and Burton’s Magazine, which
was incorporated with this, gave the first that Sartain ever
did for a magazine of large circulation; and yet these
young fellows, with the down yet upon their chins, affect
the experience of years, and learnedly talk about teaching
their grandfather how to snuff. I care nothing about this,
but that it has gone far enough; and they will after a while
begin to believe their own stories—a bit of self-deception
that it is a pity they should be subjected to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, Jeremy, we live in a funny world, and even with
our criminal code, and prison discipline, I fear me, the
moral reformer has a vast work to do. The shades of
right and wrong, as worked up in the woof of practical
life, are not of colors which contrast very strongly. They
form rather the figures of a kaleidoscope. Is there not
a little gambling done, in the way of “specimens” in
literature, as well as in “specimens” in copper? Do the
samples shown as “inducements” always honestly represent
the real article afterward put upon the purchaser?
Oh! very nice, rigid and self-complacent moralist, “with
good fat capon lined,” why are thy hands held up in such
affected holy horror at thy brother, who has stumbled and
fallen, “because he has done this thing;” when printed
records of thy falsified pledges and assertions, fill the
post-towns of the country, the Union over! The lie in
type and upon record, is it less venal, because multiplied
by thousands, than that by word, which palms upon the
unsuspecting a sinking fancy stock! Let the canting,
praying hypocrite, of all trades, go down into his own
heart, and clear it of its “dead men’s bones, and all uncleanness,”
before, with bastard honesty, he casts a stone at
his most desperate brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, Jeremy, is there not a thriving business done, by
men professing to be respectable, by “The Suction and
Pumping Process,” in most of the trades of life—even in
the very honorable business of manufacturing and selling
goods? Ay! in the thousand well dressed, painted living
lies, that stare at you in the streets, and from behind
counters, and impose upon the ignorant—is there no rascality?
When goods are put upon the poor and ignorant
hired girls at high prices—the remnants of shabby gentility—are
the shopkeepers honest do you suppose? In
the poisoned rum, that is sold for <span class='it'>good</span> (God defend us!)
and which sends destitution, misery, and crime into the
hovels of the poor—is there no weight of damnation, past
finding out? Is every marble palace, with steeds prancing
at the door, the monument of a good man’s well spent life;
has every stone and carved <a id='niche'></a>niche been paid for by money
honestly earned? Are the laces, and feathers, and gold
and jewels, that flash upon us and glitter in the sun, <span class='it'>all</span>,
always the well-earned rewards of honest and praiseworthy
toil? Much of the money thus lavishly displayed,
and on which an insolent pride fattens and corrupts, may
it not be the legitimate reward of a sin that would taint
the fingers of a thief? Hold up thy head, young brother,
and keep thy heart pure; all is not lost! the courage to
dare, the power and will to do are thine! Up! and against
wrong and oppression of every shade, set thy face as a
flint, and with conscious might and truth, press on! The
world is before thee where to choose—it is thy battle-ground!
Do nobly, and thou art man—meanly, a more
creeping thing than a worm a upon whom every coward
braggart will set his heel. Aye on! there is yet to come—thank
God—a reckoning-day, of motives and of actions,
when assumption shall be stript—deceit exposed—the
hollow heart laid bare, and when the secret sin of pride
and self-complacency, dragged from its hiding-place, shall
be thrust, blazing into its face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My dear Jeremy, there is a consolation in this—we shall
see one of these times, every man’s motive for the acts he
has committed revealed—whether it is only the poor devils
cast down, forsaken, down-trodden and despised, that die
in the ditch, who are damned; or whether he only is on
his way to heaven—the sleek and lucky moralist who
dozes over his wine—who thinks he can pave his way to
heaven with ingots, however got, that shall be saved.
That will be a sight worth seeing, Jeremy, for it will open
the eyes of the Universe, and make all things even. We
can afford to wait for even this, can we not? It will not
be long.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Poems. By Robert Browning, Boston: Ticknor, Reed &amp;
Fields. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This edition of Browning is almost a facsimile of the
beautiful London edition, published by Chapman &amp; Hall,
the only real difference between the two being that the
American reprint costs less than half as much as the
London original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Browning, for the last four or five years, has been
steadily advancing to fame; and having overcome by the
pure strength of his genius all outward and some inward
obstacles, is now widely recognized as a new force in
English letters. Next to Tennyson, we know of hardly
another English poet of the day who can be compared
with him. He possesses striking excellences both of
thought and diction, but he is so indisputably an originality,
that he is compelled to create the taste which appreciates
him. Like almost all the poets of the new school,
he is “high contemplative,” scorns rather than courts the
means of popularity, and is more pleased by conquering
one reader than by enticing many. In his distaste for the
stereotyped diction and ideas of English poetry, he is apt
to go to the opposite extreme of obscurity. There is a
beautiful willfulness, a delicious bit of the devil, in him;
accordingly many of his verses seem thrown off in an
imaginary boxing match with professors of square-toed
rhetoric and critics of the old school. This independence
and pugnacity are sometimes carried to that extreme of
recklessness, which indicates self-conceit and supercilious
arrogance, rather than a wrestling with the difficulties of
expression. “Sordello,” a poem which the author has
now suppressed, was a tangled mass of half-formed
thoughts and half-clutched sentiments, tottering dizzily on
the vanishing points of meaning; and the publication of
such a piece of elaborate worthlessness was an insult to
public intelligence which would have consigned to deserved
damnation, any poet who did not possess sufficient
genius to retrieve his reputation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his best works, Browning appears as a poet gifted
with a large reason and a wide-wandering imagination;
but his reason and imagination do not seem to work
genially together—are sometimes in each other’s way—and
in their operation they sometimes strangle each other.
He thinks broadly and deeply, and he shapes finely; but
the thought does not commonly seem born in music, but
rather born <span class='it'>with</span> music; and he often gives the idea and
the illustrative image, instead of the idea in the illustrative
image. Sometimes, in reading him, we wish he would
abandon poetry for metaphysics, so sure and clear is his
analysis and statement of mental phenomena; and then
again some magnificent comparison, metaphor or image,
or some exquisite touch of characterization, makes us
wish that he would abjure metaphysics, and cling to
poetry. Compared with Tennyson, his nature would be
called hard, and be said to lack mellowness and melody.
That sensuous element in poetry, which proceeds from
fusing thought, sensation, and imagination—the spiritual
and physical—into one sweet product, “felt in the blood,”
and felt along the brain, he does not appear to have reached;
but then the burning words, struck off like sparks from the
conflict of flint and steel, which come from him in his
periods of real excitement, seem to the reader sufficient
compensations for his comparative absence of softness and
harmony. He may not delight so much as Tennyson, but
he gives the mind a wider field to range in, inspires a
manlier feeling, and indicates a greater capacity. The
very fact that all his works are cast in a dramatic form,
even though the dramatic element is often more formal
than real, shows that his mind has a healthy affection
for objects, and steadily resists its own subjective
tendencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first poem in the collection is “Paracelsus.” This
is an attempt to exhibit the influence on character of knowledge
disjoined from love, by a delineation of an aspiring
and noble nature, smitten by a restless thirst to know, and
ruined by “the lust of his brain.” The poem is not poetically
conceived; its central idea is not organic, not the
germinating principle of the whole, but rather an abstract
proposition logically developed; and, accordingly, the
mechanical understanding not the vital imagination is predominant
throughout. Besides, though it exercises the
brain not unpleasantly, it hardly gives poetic pleasure;
and so far from comfortable is the general impression it
leaves, that the reader recurs to it only for deep or delicate
thoughts and imaginations which are separately beautiful.
As a whole, it is not philosophical enough for a treatise,
nor beautiful enough for a poem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“King Victor and King Charles” is a drama containing
four characters moderately well conceived and discriminated,
but evincing dramatic genius not much above
Bulwer’s, though profounder in sentiment, and richer in
imagination. The most dramatic passage is where Polyxena
seizes her husband’s hand, when he is on the point
of yielding to a weak amiability of nature, and conjures
him to sacrifice her happiness and his to duty. It is the
passage commencing⁠—</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Colombe’s Birth Day” is a sweet and beautiful dramatic
poem, abounding in intellectual wealth. The characters
of Colombe and Valence are vigorously drawn.
The scene between them in the fourth act, where he confesses
his love, is grand and exhilarating as an exhibition
of character and passion. But the idea of the play, that of
representing the triumph of love over wealth and rank in
a woman fully susceptible of the charms of the latter, is
the animating life of the piece. We hardly know, out of
Fletcher and Shakspeare, a play where fidelity to a sentiment
is represented with such ethereal grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In “Luria” and “The Return of the Druses,” an intimate
acquaintance is shown with the best and worst parts
of human nature, and the development of the characters
indicates that the author’s dramatic skill grows with exercise.
Luria is a noble character, original in conception,
and finely developed from “within outwards.” “A Soul’s
Tragedy” has many marked excellences of thought, and
diction, and exhibits one of the most hateful qualities in
human nature, with a blended dramatic coolness and individual
abhorrence, singularly felicitous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Dramatic Lyrics” are very striking, and are full
of matter. “Count Gismond,” “Porphyria’s Lover,”
“The Confessional,” “The Lost Leader,” and “The
Pied Piper of Hamelin,” we should select as, on the whole,
the best. The latter, written for little William Macready,
exhibits the peculiar vein of humor in which Browning
excels, and of which we have indications all over
his works. The commencement we will venture to
extract:</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the grandest pieces in the volume are “Pippa
Passes,” and “A Blot in the ’Scutcheon.” The latter, in
the opinion of Dickens, is the finest poem of the century.
We think there can be detected in it that hardness of touch
which characterizes the other dramas, but the depth and
pathos of the matter, and the approach to something like
impassioned action in the events, make it wonderfully impressive.
Once read it must haunt the imagination forever,
for its power strikes deep into the very substance and core
of the soul. Thorold’s adamantine pride, and Guendolen’s
sweet woman’s sympathy, and Mildred’s awful sorrow,
can never be forgotten. Mildred’s repetition, in moments

<p class='pindent'>We hardly know how to express our admiration of
“Pippa Passes,” making as it does the “sense of satisfaction

author’s nature seems for once to have become fluid, and
gushes out in melodious thought and passion. Pippa herself
is one of poetry’s most exquisite creations, and,
among her many “passes,” those she makes into the
hearts and imaginations of a thousand readers, ought not
to be overlooked. The design of the play is new, and it
would be difficult to state in an intellectual form the
source of its charm. Its completeness is in its seeming
incompleteness. The grandest scene is that between
Ottima and Sebald, the fine audacity of which carries us
back to the elder period of the English drama. The
greatest instance of imagination in Browning’s works is
contained in this scene. We give it below:</p>

Duties, Relations and Interests of the Medical Profession
and the Community. By Worthington Hooker, M. D.
New York: Baker &amp; Scribner. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a timely production, written by a man who appears
to have sterling honesty as well as sterling sense,
and devoted to a subject as interesting as any which can
engage the attention of the community. We hope it will
attract sufficient attention to insure its extensive circulation,
and bring it within the notice of all families. The
author grapples with his subject thoroughly, and almost
exhausts it. Owing to the various forms, genteel and
vulgar, which quackery has assumed in our day, no person,
intelligent or ignorant, is safe from some one mode of its
operation, as it has contrivances for every age, disposition,
grade of mental <a id='devel'></a>development, and social station. Dr.
Hooker has gone elaborately over the whole matter, and
has really given the philosophy as well as the facts of
empiricism, both as it exists out of the profession and in
it. He does not spare those physicians who follow medicine
as a trade, instead of pursuing it as a profession,
“and study the science of patient-getting to the neglect of
the science of patient curing,” while in showing the processes
of the quack in experimenting on the credulity of
his victims, he has done an essential service to the health
of the community. We can but reiterate the hope that
the volume, full as it is of practical wisdom, will be extensively
circulated, and do its part toward enlightening
the most quack-ridden people on the face of the earth.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>History of England from the Invasion of Julius Cæsar to
the Abdication of James the Second. By David Hume.
Boston: Phillips, Sampson &amp; Co. Vols. 1, 2, 3, 4, 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This edition of Hume is uniform with the same publishers’
edition of Macaulay. It is neatly printed in good
sized type, and is placed at a price sufficiently cheap to
bring it within the reach of the humblest reader. It is
reprinted from the last and best London edition, and is prefaced
by Hume’s delightful autobiography. It is needless
to inform our readers that the work is a classic, and ranks
with the greatest historical works ever written in this
world. But though its fame is wide, we doubt if the
generality of the reading public give it their attention.
This is really abstinence from pleasure as well as instruction,
for Hume is among the most fascinating of narrators.
His style is simple, clear, racy, and flowing, beyond that
of almost any English historian, and being but a translucent
mirror of events and reflections, it attracts no attention
to itself, and therefore never tires. The wonder of
the book is its happy union of narration and reflections and
the skill with which every thing is brought home to the
humblest capacity. It belongs to that class of works in
which power is not paraded, but unobtrusively insinuated
in thoughts carelessly dropped, as it were, in the course
of a familiar narration of interesting incidents. “Easy
writing,” said Sheridan, “is cursed hard writing.” The
easy style of Hume is an illustration. The reader, at the end,
feels that he has been keeping company with a great man,
gifted with an extraordinary grasp and subtlety of mind,
but during the journey he thought he was but chatting with
an agreeable and intelligent familiar companion.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Success in Life. The Merchant. By Mrs. L. C. Tuthill.
New York: Geo. P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The present volume is the first of a series of six, in
which the authoress intends to indicate the <span class='it'>rationale</span> of the
successful merchant, lawyer, mechanic, artist, physician
and farmer, illustrating each department by biographical
anecdotes. We have here, as the leader of the series, a
volume on The Merchant. The style is gossiping, without
much pretension to beauty or correctness, but the
matter indicates a shrewd mind and extensive miscellaneous
reading. There is one chapter devoted almost
wholly to Robert Morris, a man whose amplitude of mind
comprehended both statesmanship and commerce, and
whom Burke might have adduced in proof of his assertion,
that he had known merchants with the large conceptions
of statesmen, and statesmen with the little notions of
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
pedlars. Mrs. Tuthill chats very agreeably of Morris,
and among other anecdotes of him, gives a laconic letter
he wrote to some French officers in the American army,
on their insolently demanding an immediate settlement of
their arrears of pay. Here it is, and it is a good example of
cutting knots which cannot be untied: “Gentlemen,—I
have received this morning your application. I make the
earliest answer to it. You demand immediate payment, I
have no money to pay you with.” We extract this letter as
a model to those of our readers who are often puzzled, under
similar circumstances, to hit upon the right mode of announcing
such uncomfortable demands to perform the
impossible.</p>

with Sixteen Engravings, and a Portrait of the
Author. Philadelphia: J. W. Bradley, 48 North Fourth
Street, 1849.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Arthur’s name, as a delineator of American character
and manners, and an earnest and sincere advocate of sound,
uncompromising morality, is already familiar to the reading
public, not only in the United States but in Europe.
His object, in every production of his able pen, is well
understood to be utility—utility in the highest sense of
the word, that which has reference to man’s eternal wellbeing.
In his lighter as well as in his graver effusions, the
same exalted object is always kept steadily in view. He
writes to improve the characters and exalt the aim of his
readers. This is the secret of his wide-spread popularity.
Men love and respect those who exhibit a steady, consistent,
and persevering adherence to principle. In the
princely mansions of the Atlantic merchants, and in the
rude log-cabins of the backwoodsmen, the name of Arthur
is equally known and cherished as the friend of virtue, and
the eloquent advocate of temperance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work before us is a judicious selection made by the
author himself, from his most popular tales. His numerous
admirers will rejoice in an opportunity to possess themselves
of so considerable a number of his best performances,
not in the fugitive shape of articles for the journals, but in
an elegant volume of over four hundred octavo pages,
richly illustrated with engravings, and handsomely got up
in every respect. We predict for this volume a very extensive
sale, and particularly recommend it as a highly appropriate
gift-book in the present holyday season. As it
is a subscription book, it will be sold only by agents. Mr.
J. W. Bradley, 48 North Fourth street, Philadelphia, is

Translated by Francis A. Darivage and William
S. Chase. Boston: Phillips; Sampson &amp; Co. 1 vol.
12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is an admirable translation of a work requiring
something more than a knowledge of French to be well
translated. The spirit is rendered as well as the letter. The
book itself, will outlive all of Lamartine’s other productions,
from its connection with a great historical event, even
if it were not invaluable as a psychological curiosity. No
reader who penetrates into its animating spirit, curious to
discover in Lamartine’s individual character the source
of its miraculous self-content can resist the impression
that the author considers himself so much a god, that he
would not be in the least surprised if a band of fanatics
should erect a temple for his worship. No man, whose
nature was not in his own estimation raised above human
nature, could possibly have the face to present such a work
as the present to the public eye. It is a sentimental
apotheosis of the writer. The reader finds the narrative
of the events of the revolution altogether inferior in interest
to the exhibition of Lamartine, and he is lost in wonder
as he thinks what must be the character of a nation in
which such a man could be lifted into power. The author,
beyond any man we have ever known through history,
fiction, or actual life, can fasten his gaze on himself as
mirrored in his self-esteem, and exclaim, “thou art beautiful
and good.” Old John Bunyan, in descending one
day from the pulpit, where he had preached with tremendous
power, was accosted by an old lady with the compliment,
“Oh! what a refreshing sermon!” “Yes,” replied
Bunyan, “the Devil whispered in my ear to that
effect as I came down.” Now this devil is at Lamartine’s
ear all the time, but Lamartine mistakes him for an angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are glad to welcome Mr. Paulding back again to the

There is a bitter, if we may not call it saucy, brilliancy
about our author, which we think is rather a recommendation
than otherwise, and in the present volumes he has
exhibited it to his heart’s and gall’s content. The work is
dedicated, in a humorously reckless and critic-defying
preface, to the “most high and mighty sovereign of sovereigns,
King People,” and scattered through the novel are
abundant pleasant impertinences, sufficiently marked by
individual whim and crotchet, to stimulate the reader to go
on reading, even should the interest of the story flag. We
have only had time to dip into the work, here and there,
but have read enough to know that it “means mischief,”
and that it has more than Mr. Paulding’s common raciness
and plain speaking.</p>

conforming in style to <span class='it'>Paul and Virginia</span>, and the <span class='it'>Vicar

We cannot speak too highly of the typographical execution
of the volumes before us, or the magnificent binding in
which they are enclosed. Both are superb, and reflect
credit alike on the publishers, and the artists who have invested

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Poet’s Offering</span>, is the title of a splendid volume of
nearly six hundred pages, edited by Mrs. <span class='sc'>Hale</span>, and published
by Messrs. <span class='sc'>Gregg &amp; Elliott</span>. It is beautifully
illustrated, and will, we think, prove one of the most popular
gift books of the season—for it is a gift book—as
the fair editor justly remarks, on a new plan, the contents
of which are of more value than the cover, and she does
not assume too much, when she declares that in this
volume will be found the most perfect gems of genius the
English language has preserved since the days of Spenser.
More than four hundred authors are quoted, and in the
arrangement of the book, great care has been taken to
exhibit the peculiar excellencies of each writer. That
Mrs. Hale has acquitted herself admirably in the execution
of an arduous undertaking, is an unquestionable fact,
and her efforts have been nobly seconded by the liberality
of the publishers, in sparing neither labor nor expense to
prepare for the public taste a most beautiful, valuable, and
acceptable volume.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
